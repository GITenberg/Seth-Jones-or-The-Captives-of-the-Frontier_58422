<p>In this fine story we have reproduced, to the life, the Kentucky of
the year 1800. It is one of the most exciting and absorbing of
stories, embracing such characters and incidents as only Kentucky
can produce. Jo Daviess was one of the most remarkable men of
that remarkable period. He plays in the novel such a part as only
Jo Daviess could play in and out of court. The great charm of Mrs.
Victor’s works is heightened by the fact that her characters are historically
true. In reading her novels we have, besides the story,
real expositions of men and veritable events. This her last, is, also,
one of her best. It will not fail to command a wide sale.</p>

<span class="cheaderfont">THE STRANGER.</span></h2>


<p>The clear ring of an ax was echoing through the arches of
a forest, three-quarters of a century ago; and an athletic man
was swinging the instrument, burying its glittering blade deep
in the heart of the mighty kings of the wood.</p>

<p>Alfred Haverland was an American, who, a number of
years before, had emigrated from the more settled provinces in
the East, to this then remote spot in western New York.
Here, in the wilderness, he had reared a humble home, and,
with his loving partner, and a sister, laid the foundation for a
settlement. True, this “settlement” was still small, consisting
only of the persons mentioned, and a beautiful blue-eyed
maiden, their daughter; but Haverland saw that the tide of
emigration was rolling rapidly and surely to the west, and,
ere many years, the villages and cities would take the place
of the wild forest, while the Indians would be driven farther
on toward the setting sun.</p>

<p>The woodman was a splendid specimen of “nature’s noblemen.”
His heavy coat lay upon a log a short distance away,
and his swelling, ponderous chest was covered only by a close-fitting
under garment, with the collar thrown open, showing
the glowing neck and heaving breast. Substantial pants met
the strong moccasins which encased his feet. A small raccoon-skin
cap rested upon the back of his head, exposing his forehead,
while his black hair swept around his shoulders. His
features were regular and strongly marked. The brow was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
rather heavy, the nose of the Roman cast, and the eyes of a
glittering blackness. So he stood with one foot thrust forward;
his muscles, moving and ridging as they were called
in to play, betrayed their formidable strength.</p>

<p>Still the flashing ax sank deeper and deeper into the oak’s
red heart, until it had gone clean through and met the breach
upon the opposite side. Then the grand old forest king began
to totter. Haverland stepped back and ran his eye to the top,
as he noticed it yielding. Slowly it leaned, increasing each
second, until it rushed seemingly forward, and came down to
the earth with a thundering crash and rebound. He stood a
moment, his hot breath issuing like steam from his chest, and
then moved forward toward its branches. At that instant his
trained ear detected a suspicious sound, and dropping his ax,
he caught up his rifle and stood on the defensive.</p>

<p>“How de do? how de do? ain’t frightened I hope; it’s
nobody but me, <span class="smcap">Seth Jones</span>, from New Hampshire,” said the
new-comer in a peculiar accent. As the woodman looked up
he saw a curious specimen of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">genus homo</i> before him. He
is what is termed a <em>Yankee</em>, being from New Hampshire; but
he was such a person as is rarely met with, and yet which is
too often described now-a-days. He possessed a long, thin
Roman nose, a small twinkling gray eye, with a lithe muscular
frame, and long dangling limbs. His feet were encased in
well-fitting shoes, while the rest of his dress was such as was
in vogue on the frontiers at the time of which we write. His
voice was in that peculiar, uncertain state, which is sometimes
seen when it is said to be “changing.” When excited, it
made sounds singular and unimaginable.</p>

<p>The woodman, with characteristic penetration, read the man
before him at a glance. Changing his rifle to his left hand,
he extended the other.</p>

<p>“Certainly not, my friend; but then, you know, these are
times, in which it behooves us all to use caution and prudence;
and where one is placed in such a remote section as
this it would be criminal to be careless, when more than one
life is dependent upon me for support and protection.”</p>

<p>“Very true, very true, you’re right there, Mr. &mdash;&mdash; ah! I
declare, I don’t know your name.”</p>

<p>“Haverland.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>

<p>“You’re right, as I said, Mr. Have-your-land, or Haverland
as the case may be. I tell <em>you</em> these <em>are</em> dubious times&mdash;no
disputin’ that, and I am considerably s’prised when I heard
the ring of an ax down in these parts.”</p>

<p>“And I was equally surprised to meet your visage when I
looked up. Jones, I believe you said was your name.”</p>

<p>“Exactly:&mdash;Seth Jones, from New Hampshire. The Jones’
are a numerous family up there&mdash;rather too many of them for
comfort,&mdash;so I migrated. Mought be acquainted perhaps?”</p>

<p>“No; I have no acquaintances, to my knowledge, in that
section.”</p>

<p>“Haven’t, eh? Thought the Jones’ were pretty generally
known through the country. Some remarkable geniuses have
sprung from the family? But what under the sun keeps you
out in this heathen country? What brought you here?”</p>

<p>“Enterprise, sir; I was tired of the civilized portion of our
country, and, when such glorious fields were offered to the
emigrant, as are here spread before him, I considered it a duty
to avail myself of them, and I have done so. And now, sir,
be equally frank with me, and let me know what induced you
to visit this perilous region when you had no reason to suppose
that a settlement had yet been commenced by the whites.
You look to me as if you were an Indian hunter or scout.”</p>

<p>“Wal, perhaps I am. At any rate I have been. I was scout
among the Green Mountain Boys, under Colonel Allen, and
staid with them till the Revolution was finished. After that,
I went down on the farm and worked a while with the old
man. Something occurred in our neighborhood that led me
to think, it was best for me to leave, I won’t say what it was,
but I will say it was no crime I committed. I stopped at the
settlement down the river a few days, and then come to the
conclusion to take a tramp in these parts.”</p>

<p>“I am very glad you have come, for it isn’t often you get
sight of a white face. I hope you will take the welcome of a
backwoodsman, and make your home with us as long a time
as you can&mdash;remembering that the longer you stay, the more
welcome you will be.”</p>

<p>“I shall probably stay till you git tired of me, at any rate,”
laughed the eccentric Seth Jones.</p>

<p>“As you are from the East, probably you can give information<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
of the state of feeling among the Indians between that
section and us. From your remarks, I should infer, however,
that nothing very serious threatens.”</p>

<p>“Don’t know ’bout that,” replied Seth, shaking his head
and looking to the ground.</p>

<p>“Why so, my friend?”</p>

<p>“I tell you what, you, I heerd orful stories ’long the way.
They say since this war, the darned red-coats have kept the
Injins at work. Leastways it’s pretty sartin they are at work,
anyhow.”</p>

<p>“Are you sure?” asked the woodman, betraying an anxiety
in his speech.</p>

<p>“Purty sure. There’s a little settlement down here some
miles, (I have forgot the name,) sot on by the imps, and burned
all up.”</p>

<p>“Is it possible? Reports have reached me during the past
three or four months, of the deadly hostility existing between
the whites and reds, but I was glad to doubt it. Although, I
sometimes felt it was wrong.”</p>

<p>“’Twas so; and if you vally that ar wife of your bussum,
and your little cherubims, (as I allow you’ve got,) you’d better
be makin’ tracks for safer quarters. Why, how have you stood
it so long?”</p>

<p>“My conduct toward the Indians has ever been characterized
by honesty and good will upon my part, and they have
ever evinced a friendly feeling toward me, and my helpless
ones. I place great reliance upon this state of feeling, in fact,
my <em>only reliance</em>.</p>

<p>“Just so; but I tell you, it won’t do to trust an Ingin.
They’re obstropertous. Go to put your finger on them, and
they ain’t thar. Jest so, by gracious.”</p>

<p>“I fear there is too much truth in your suspicions,” replied
Haverland, in a saddened tone.</p>

<p>“I’m glad I’ve tumbled onto you, coz I begin to git skeerish,
and I like to do a feller a good turn, and I’ll stick to you,
bein’ I’ve found you.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, friend, and let us now proceed homeward. I
intended to spend the day in work, but your words have taken
away all desire.”</p>

<p>“Sorry to do it; but it’s best, ain’t it?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>

<p>“Certainly, it would have been wrong, had you not warned
me of impending danger. Let us go home.”</p>

<p>So saying, Alfred drew on his coat, slung his rifle and ax
over his shoulder, and struck into a path in the forest, which
he himself had used, and with a thoughtful tread, made his
way homeward. Close behind him, followed his new-made
friend.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II"></a>CHAPTER II.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">THE DARK CLOUD.</span></h2>


<p>During the walk homeward, Haverland spoke but few
words, although his loquacious friend kept up a continual, unremitting
stream of talk. The woodman’s heart was too
heavy to join him in his humorous, pointless words. Although
dark and fearful suspicions had flitted before him, he had closed
his eyes upon them, until he could no longer shun them, they
appeared at every turn, and now resumed a terrible certainty.</p>

<p>Although at the time of which we refer, the Revolutionary
struggle of the colonies had closed, and their freedom was
placed upon a firm basis, yet universal peace by no means
reigned. Dark, sanguinary, and bloody tragedies were constantly
enacted upon the frontiers for a generation afterward.
The mother country, failing in her work of subjugation, continued
to incite the Indians to revolting barbarities upon the
unoffending inhabitants. They found them too-willing instruments,
and, instigated by them, a protracted war was long
maintained; and, when the moving cause was removed, the
savages still continued the unequal conflict. As every one
acquainted with our history must know, the war on the frontiers
has been an almost interminable one. As the tide of emigration
has rolled westward, it has ever met that fiery counter-surge,
and only overcome it, by incessant battling and effort.
And even now, as the distant shores of the Pacific are well
nigh reached, that resisting wave still gives forth its lurid
flashes of conflict.</p>

<p>In a pleasant valley, stood the humble home of Alfred Haverland.
His own vigorous arm had cleared off a space on all
sides, so that his residence stood at some distance from the
forest, which rolled away for miles. In the clearing still remained
the stumps of the fallen trees, and in some places the
rich, virgin soil had been broken, and was giving signs of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
exhaustless wealth it retained in its bosom, waiting only for
the hand of man to bring it forth.</p>

<p>The house itself, was such as are generally found in new
settlements. A number of heavy logs, placed compactly together,
with an opening for a door, and one for a window,
were all that could attract attention from the outside. Within,
were two apartments, the lower and upper. The former was
used for all purposes except that of sleeping, which, of course,
was done in the upper. In building it, Haverland had made
little preparations for defence, as he fondly hoped it would
never be needed for such, and it seemed to him that the idea
of danger would ever be before him, should he construct it
thus. And, besides, should he use his utmost skill in the purpose
mentioned, he knew it would avail him little. He had
no means of withstanding a protracted siege, and a handful of
assailants could bring him to any terms.</p>

<p>As he stepped forth into the clearing, Ina, his daughter,
caught sight of him, and bounded out the cabin to meet him.</p>

<p>“Oh, father! I am glad you have come back so soon, but
dinner isn’t ready. Did you think it was? I was just telling
mother&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>She paused suddenly, as she caught sight of a stranger, and
with her hand on her mouth, stood, fearing to approach, and
afraid to yield to the impulse of turning, and running into the
house again.</p>

<p>“No, I didn’t think dinner-time had come, but as I had a
friend to visit me, I thought I could entertain him at home
better than in the woods. But where is your kiss, dear?”</p>

<p>The father stooped, and touched his lips to the ruby ones of
his blooming child, and taking her hand, moved forward toward
the cabin.</p>

<p>“Whew! if that ain’t a purty flower, then kick me!” exclaimed
Seth Jones, in admiration. “Was she originated in
these parts? Darter, I s’pose? Perhaps not, though?”</p>

<p>“Yes, she is my daughter, although she was not born in
these parts.”</p>

<p>“Dew tell. Darned if she ain’t a beauty, and that makes
what I said&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>The father motioned to him that the theme was forbidden,
and they walked silently toward the house.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>

<p>It was no wonder that Ina Haverland drew forth such encomiums
from Seth Jones. She was, indeed, a beautiful creature.
She had seen some fifteen or sixteen summers, several of
which had been spent in the wilderness, which was now her
home. She was rather small in stature, but graceful as a gazelle,
free from the restraints which the conventionalities of
life impose upon those of her age. She had dark hair, gathered
in a roll behind, fine expressive blue eyes, a perfect Grecian
nose, thin lips, and full chin, rendering the profile perfectly
straight from the forehead downward. Her face was
oval, and her complexion almost too light for a full enjoyment
of health. Her dress was a semi-civilized one, consisting of
a short skirt, with leggins beautifully wrought, and a loose
sack, similar to the ones worn at the present day. Her
small feet were encased in tiny mocassins, elaborately wrought
with beads and Indian ornaments, and a string of wampum
hung around the neck.</p>

<p>She led the way toward the house, and the three entered.</p>

<p>Haverland introduced his friend to his sister and wife, as a
man who had chanced down in this direction, and who would
probably tarry a few days. But the quick eye of his wife
caught the thoughtful expression upon her husband’s face, and
she felt there was something yet unrevealed&mdash;something deeper
and more important, that was to be disclosed. She, however,
forbore questioning or hinting, knowing that he would
communicate what was necessary, when he deemed the proper
time had come.</p>

<p>A common-place conversation was maintained until the
meal was prepared by the busy housewife, when they all
gathered around the board. An earnest blessing was invoked
upon the humble food, and it was partaken of in silence.</p>

<p>“Wife,” said Haverland tenderly, “I will depart awhile with
this friend here, and you and Mary may busy yourselves as you
think best till I return. Probably I will not be back until
toward night. Take no anxiety upon my account.”</p>

<p>“I will endeavor not to, but, dear husband, go not far from
home, for strange fears have come over me since morning.”</p>

<p>Even the usually staid and calm face of Mary, betrayed
an unusual expression of anxiety.</p>

<p>“Fear not, wife, I will not go far.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<p>Haverland now stepped outside, where he saw Seth, all
agape, gazing at Ina, as she passed to and fro in the house.</p>

<p>“By gracious, you, I’m goin’ to fall in love with that gal.
No ’bjections, hope?”</p>

<p>“No,” answered Haverland, with a faint smile, “her heart
is unfettered, and I hope it will remain so for a long time.”</p>

<p>“Oh! I don’t mean to love her as you dew yer old woman&mdash;yer
wife. I mean jest as I would my darter, yer know.
She’s too small to think about lovyers <em>yit</em>. Don’t you let <em>sich</em>
a thing git inter her head for five years or more.”</p>

<p>“I’ll try not to; but let us take a walk. I have something
to say, which I would that they should not know for the
present.”</p>

<p>“All right&mdash;but jest hold on a minute.”</p>

<p>At this juncture, Ina appeared with a small vessel, as if she
intended bringing some water from some spring nigh at hand.</p>

<p>“Hold on a minute, gal, my beauty,” said Seth, stepping
forward, and reaching for the pail. “That’s too big a load for
you to carry.”</p>

<p>“No, I have done it often, thank you, but it is no work
for me.”</p>

<p>“But jest let me fetch it <em>this</em> time, if only to show my good
will, and my activity.”</p>

<p>Ina laughingly yielded the vessel, and watched him as he
took long, awkward strides toward the point where the path
led into the forest.</p>

<p>“How far is it off?” he asked, turning round, as he reached
the point mentioned.</p>

<p>“A short distance,” answered Haverland, “the path leads
to it.”</p>

<p>Seth made some unintelligible answer, as he jerked his head
back and disappeared.</p>

<p>This simple occurrence that we have just narrated, although
trivial in itself, was one of the circumstances which often controls
important acts, and which seem to show that an all-wise
Ruler, orders them to suit His purpose, and to bring about
good in the end. Seth Jones had no object other than a little
amusement in his course, yet before he returned, he saw how
fortunate it was.</p>

<p>He strode rapidly forward, and after passing a short distance,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
reached the spring. As he stooped, he was sure he
heard a movement in the bushes beyond; and, as he was
about to dip the vessel, he saw in the smooth face of the water,
a movement in the shrubbery. He had too much cunning
and prudence to affect knowledge of it, and he filled the vessel
without betraying any signs of suspicion. As he rose to
the upright position, he gave an apparently careless sweep of
his vision, and not twenty feet distant he saw the crouching
forms of two Indians! As he turned his back, there was a
peculiar, uncomfortable feeling, as he knew that it was the
easiest matter in the world to receive one or two cold bullets.
He, however, quickened his step not in the least, and manifested
no uneasiness, as he came to view in the clearing; and
laughingly handed the water to Ina.</p>

<p>“Come, let us go,” said Haverland, moving toward the
spring.</p>

<p>“Not that ar way, by a long shot!” said Seth, with a meaning
shake of his head.</p>

<p>“Why not?”</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you purty soon.”</p>

<p>“Let us to the river, then?”</p>

<p>“That’ll do, ’specially <em>as it ain’t fur from your house</em>!”</p>

<p>Haverland looked searchingly at him, and he saw there
was a deep meaning behind these words, yet he said nothing,
and led the way toward the river.</p>

<p>This stream was but a few hundred yards from the house,
and flowed in a northerly and southerly direction. It was
very smooth at this point, and not very wide, yet a mile or so
farther down, it debouched into a large, broad, and deep river.
The banks were lined, most of the distance, by close, impenetrable
shrubbery, overreached by lofty trees, which were the
edges of the almost interminable wilderness that then covered
this part of the State, and of which great portions remain unto
the present day.</p>

<p>Haverland moved to a spot where he had often stood and
conversed with his wife, when they first entered the place.
Resting his rifle upon the earth, and folding his arms over the
muzzle, he turned around and looked Seth full in the face.</p>

<p>“What did you mean, by telling me not to <em>go far from</em> the
house?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>

<p>“Jest hole on a bit,” replied Seth, bending his ear as if to
listen. Haverland watched him earnestly, and he also heard
something unusual&mdash;as if some one were rowing a canoe in
the water. His companion then stepped down to the water’s
edge, and signalized for him to approach. Haverland did so,
and looked down the river. Some hundred yards off he saw
a canoe rapidly moving down stream, impelled by the oars of
three Indians!</p>

<p>“That is what I meant,” said he in a whisper, stepping back.</p>

<p>“Did you see them?” asked Haverland.</p>

<p>“I reckon I did. They were at the spring, watching for
your gal to come, so that they mought run off with her.”</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III"></a>CHAPTER III.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">THE DARK CLOUD BURSTS.</span></h2>


<p>“Are you certain?” asked Haverland, with a painful eagerness.</p>

<p>“As sure as I live!”</p>

<p>“How? when? where did you see them? Pray, answer
quick, for I feel that the lives of precious ones stand in peril.”</p>

<p>“The facts are few&mdash;they are. When I went down to the
spring, I seed them pesky varmints thar, and I knowed they
war waitin’ for your little booty, ’cause if they wa’n’t, they’d
have walloped me thunderin’ soon. I seed ’em sneaking
’round, and purtended as though I didn’t ’spicion nothin’.
They’ve found I’s about, and have gone down for more help.
They’ll be back here to-night with a whole pack. Fact, by
gracious!”</p>

<p>“You speak truly; and, as matters stand thus, it is time
for <em>action</em>.”</p>

<p>“Exactly so; and what is it you propose to dew?”</p>

<p>“As you have afforded me such signal aid thus far, I must
again ask you for advice.”</p>

<p>“Pshaw! don’t you know what to dew, man?”</p>

<p>“I have a plan, but I would hear yours first.”</p>

<p>“Wal, I can give it purty soon. You know well enough
you’re in tight quarters, and the best thing you can do is to
git away from here a leetle quicker nor no time. You know
the settlements ain’t more nor twenty miles off, and you’d
better pack up and be off, and lose no time, neither.”</p>

<p>“That was my plan, exactly. But hold! we must go by
water, and will it not be best to wait and go by night, when
we will have the darkness to protect us? We have just
learned that the river contains enough enemies to frustrate
our designs should they be known. Yes, we must wait till
night.”</p>

<p>“You’re right there; and, as there is no moon, we’ll have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
a good chance, especially as we have to go down stream
instead of up. I tell <em>yeou</em>, the war <em>is</em> going on. When I left
home, I had an idee things would be fixed so as to stop these
infarnal redskins from committin’ on their depredations,
although they looked mighty squally; but ’tain’t no use, and
it won’t do to trust these critters.”</p>

<p>Shortly after, Haverland turned and entered the house,
followed by Seth. He called his wife and sister in, and
explained, in a few words, the circumstances. It was but a
realization of the fears entertained, and no time was lost in
useless laments. Preparations were immediately made for the
removal. The woodman owned a large boat, somewhat
similar to the flat-boats seen at this day upon the western
waters. This was hauled in beneath the shrubbery which
overhung the bank, and into this their things were placed.
During the removal Seth remained along the river-bank,
keeping watch of the stream, lest their enemies might return
unawares.</p>

<p>The removal occupied most of the afternoon, and it was not
until the shadows were lengthening across the river, that the
last article was placed on board. This completed, all seated
themselves in the boat, and waited for the rapidly approaching
darkness, to glide out into the stream.</p>

<p>“It is hard,” said Haverland, somewhat moodily, “to leave
one’s home after all the difficulty in rearing it is finished.”</p>

<p>“Fact, by gracious!” added Seth, whom Mary eyed very
closely, as if not satisfied with the fellow’s ways and looks.</p>

<p>“But it is best, dear husband. Let us hope, now, that the
war is ended, and that, as we have passed through as great
dangers as those that now threaten us, the time is not far
distant when we may return to this spot with safety.”</p>

<p>“We can but die once,” said Mary, abstractedly, “and I
am ready for any fate.”</p>

<p>Seth studied her face with a quick, keen glance, then smiled,
and said: “Oh, you look a here, now. <em>I</em> am captain here, by
your leave, my dears, and I ain’t goin’ to allow any sick
stomachs in this here crew.” His sunny face seemed greatly
to encourage the little band.</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t fear to remain here now,” said Ina, bravely;
“I am <em>sure</em> we soon may return. I <em>feel</em> it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>Haverland kissed his child, but made no further reply, and
all relapsed into a stillness, and ceased further conversation.
There was something in the gathering gloom around, something
in the peculiar situation in which they were placed, that
imparted a despondency to all. The boat was still fastened
to the shore, and the time for loosening it was close at hand.
Mrs. Haverland had passed within the rude cabin, the door
of which remained open, while Seth and the husband remained
in the stern. Ina sat near at hand, and had fallen into the
same silence that rested upon the others.</p>

<p>“Doesn’t it look dark and awful back there?” she asked, in
a whisper, of Seth, pointing toward the shore.</p>

<p>“It does somewhat, I think.”</p>

<p>“And yet I wouldn’t be afraid to go back to the house.”</p>

<p>“You’d better stay in the boat, young ’un.”</p>

<p>“You think I am <em>afraid</em>, do you?” she said, bounding out
the boat to the shore.</p>

<p>“Ina! Ina! what do you mean?” asked the father,
sternly.</p>

<p>“Oh, nothing; only I want to take a little run to ease my
limbs.”</p>

<p>“Come back here instantly!”</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;oh, father! quick! quick! come take me!”</p>

<p>“Seize the oar and shove out!” commanded Seth, springing
into the water, and shoving the boat off.</p>

<p>“But, for God’s sake, my child!”</p>

<p>“You can’t help her&mdash;the Injins have got her. I see ’em;
drop quick, they’re goin’ to fire! Look out!”</p>

<p>At that instant there was the sharp crack of several rifles
from the shore, and several tongues of fire flamed from the
darkness, and the wild yell of a number of Indians pealed out
in horrid strength.</p>

<p>Had it not been for Seth all would have been lost. He
comprehended every thing in an instant, and saved the others.</p>

<p>“Oh, father! mother! The Indians have got me!” came
in agonized accents from the shore.</p>

<p>“Merciful God! must I see my child perish without heeding
her cry?” groaned Haverland, in spirit.</p>

<p>“No, they won’t hurt her, and we must take care of ourselves
while we can. Don’t stand up, for they can see you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<p>“Father, will you leave me?” came again in heart-rending
tones.</p>

<p>“Don’t be scart, young ’un,” called out Seth; “keep up a
good heart. I’ll git you agin ef you behave yourself. I will,
as sure as I am Seth Jones. Just keep up pluck, little one.”
The last words were shouted loudly, for the boat was fast
gliding into the stream.</p>

<p>The mother had heard all, and said nothing. She comprehended
it, and with a groan sank back upon a seat. Mary’s
eyes flashed like a tigress at bay; and she did not cease to
cast looks of indignation at Seth, for leaving the child to her
horrid fate so coolly. But she said nothing&mdash;was as quiet and
pale as a statue. Seth eyed her like a lynx; his eyeballs
seemed like fire. But he was as cool as if at his ease perfectly;
and he quickly made all feel that he was born for such
appalling emergencies.</p>

<p>They were now within the center of the stream, and moving
quite rapidly. The darkness was so great that the shores
were now vailed from sight. And with hearts in as deep a
gloom the fugitives floated downward.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV"></a>CHAPTER IV.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">THE LOST HOME AND A FOUND FRIEND.</span></h2>


<p>It was on the morning of the day which we have just seen
close. As will be remembered the air was clear and the day
one of the most beautiful and pleasant of the year. The air
was perfectly still, and had that peculiar, bracing sharpness,
which is only felt when it is in a perfect state of rest. It was
such a morning as would make every healthy person feel that
to merely <em>live</em> was pleasure.</p>

<p>That part of the State of New York in which the first
scenes of this life drama are laid, was a country at this time
cut up and diversified by numerous streams&mdash;the greater number
of comparatively small size, but a few of considerable magnitude.
Skirting and between these were thousands of acres
of thick luxuriant forest, while in some places were plains of
great extent entirely devoid of timber.</p>

<p>It was about the middle of the day referred to, that a single
horseman was slowly skirting one of these open patches of
country, a few miles distant from Haverland’s home. A mere
glance would have shown that he had come a great distance,
and both he and the animal he bestrode were jaded and well-nigh
worn out. He was a young man, some twenty or twenty-five
years of age, attired in the costume of a hunter; and,
although fatigued with his long ride, the watchfulness of his
motions would have shown any one that he was no stranger
to frontier life. He was rather prepossessing in appearance&mdash;had
fine dark eyes, curly hair and whiskers, an expressive Roman
nose, and small and finely formed mouth. In front, a
long polished rifle rested across the saddle ready for use at
a second’s warning. His horse’s sides were steaming and
foamy, and the animal made his way along with painfully evident
weariness.</p>

<p>As the day waned, the traveler looked about him with more
interest and eagerness. He carefully examined the streams he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
crossed, and the pieces of woods, as though searching for some
landmark or habitation. At length he manifested a pleasure
in what he saw, as though the signs were as he wished, and
hurried the lagging steps of his animal.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said he to himself, “the woodman’s house can not be
far from this. I remember this stream, and that wood yonder.
I shall then be able to reach it by night. Come, my
good horse, go ahead with better spirits, for you are near your
journey’s end.”</p>

<p>A short time after, he crossed a small stream that dashed
and foamed over its rocky bed, and entered the broad tract
which led to the clearing in front of Haverland’s door. But
although he had a tolerably correct idea of his situation, he
had sadly miscalculated the distance. It was already dusk
when he struck the stream several miles above where we
have seen the fugitives take it. This river, or creek, he knew
led directly by the cabin he was seeking, and he determined
to keep it until he had reached his destination. His progress
was now quite tardy, from being often obliged to pass around
the thick undergrowth which lined the river; and, when he
reached a point that he knew was a mile distant from Haverland’s
cabin, it was far in the night.</p>

<p>“Come, my good horse, we have had a longer tramp than
I expected, but we are now very near the termination of our
journey. Heigh! what does that mean?”</p>

<p>The last exclamation, or question, was caused by seeing directly
ahead of him, a bright lurid glare shot high into the
heavens.</p>

<p>“Can it be that the woodman’s house is fired? Impossible!
and yet that is the precise spot. Heavens! something
is wrong!”</p>

<p>Agitated by strong and painful emotions, Everard Graham
(such was his name) now hurried his horse toward the spot
from which the light emanated. In a short time he had proceeded
as far as he dared with his horse, then dismounting,
he tied him, and made his way cautiously forward on foot.
The light was so strong that he found it necessary to pick his
way with the greatest care.</p>

<p>A few moments sufficed to show him all.</p>

<p>He saw the house of Haverland, the one in which he expected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
to pass the night, but one mass of flame. And around
it were a score of dark forms, leaping and dancing, and appearing
in the ghastly light, like fiends in a ghostly revel.</p>

<p>Graham stood a moment spell-bound with horror and
amazement. He expected to see the reeking bodies of Haverland
and his family, or hear their groans of agony; but, as he
continued gazing, he became convinced that they were either
slain or had escaped, as there were no signs of their presence.
He could not think they had escaped, and was compelled to
believe they had been tomahawked, and perished in the
flames.</p>

<p>It was a ghastly and almost unearthly sight&mdash;the small
cabin, crackling and roaring in one mass of living flame,
throwing strange shadows across the clearing, and lighting up
the edges of the forest with a brightness almost as great as the
sun at noonday&mdash;the score of dusky beings, leaping and shouting
in wild exultation, and the vast wilderness, shutting down
like an ocean of darkness around.</p>

<p>Gradually the flames lessened, and the woods seemed to retreat
into the gloom; the shouts of the savages ceased, and
they too, disappeared; and the building, which hitherto was
a mass of crackling fire, was now a heap of slumbering coals
and embers, which glowed with a hot redness in the darkness.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>An hour or two afterward, a shadowy form could have been
seen gliding stealthily and silently around the glowing ruins.
He appeared like a specter as seen by the reflected light of the
slumbering coals, or might have been taken for the shadow of
some ruin of the building. At intervals, he paused and listened,
as though he half expected to hear the footfall of some
one, and then again continued his ghostly march around the
ruins. Several times he stopped and peered into the embers,
as though he supposed the whitened bones of some human
being would greet his vision, and then he recoiled and stood
as if in deep and painful thought. It was Everard Graham,
searching for the remains of Haverland and his family.</p>

<p>“I see nothing,” he said musingly, “and it may be that
they have escaped, or perhaps their bodies are now cooking in
that heap of coals, and yet something tells me that they are
not. And if it is not thus, what can have become of them?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
How could they have eluded the malignant vengeance of their
savage foes? Who could have warned them? Ah, me! in
spite of the unaccountable hope which I feel, my own sense
tells me, that there are no grounds for it. Sad is the fate of
the unprotected at this time.”</p>

<p>“Fact, by gracious!”</p>

<p>Graham started as though he had been shot, and gazed
around. A few yards off he could just discover the outlines
of a man, standing as if he were contemplating himself.</p>

<p>“And who are you?” he asked, “that appears upon this
spot at such a time?”</p>

<p>“I am Seth Jones, from New Hampshire. Who mought
be you that happens down in these parts at this pertickler
time?”</p>

<p>“Who am I? I am Everard Graham, a friend of the man
whose house is in ruins, and who, I fear, has been slaughtered
with his family.”</p>

<p>“Exactly so; but don’t speak so loud. There mought be
others about, you know. Jist let’s step back here where ’taint
likely we’ll be obsarved.”</p>

<p>The speaker retreated into the darkness, while Graham followed
him. At first he had had some slight misgivings, but
the tones and voice of the stranger reassured him, and he followed
him without distrust or hesitation.</p>

<p>“You say you’re a friend of Haverland’s, eh?” asked Seth in
a whisper.</p>

<p>“I am, sir; I was acquainted with him before he moved
out in these parts. He was an intimate friend of my father’s,
and I promised to pay him a visit as soon as I could possibly
do so, and I am here for that purpose.”</p>

<p>“Jest so, but you took a rayther ticklish time for it, I
reckon.”</p>

<p>“So it seems; but, if I wished to wait till it would be perfectly
safe, I am afraid my visit would never be made.”</p>

<p>“Fact, by gracious!”</p>

<p>“But allow me to ask whether you know any thing of the
family?”</p>

<p>“I reckon that, perhaps, it mought be possible I do, seeing
as how I’ve been around these times.”</p>

<p>“Are they slain, or captives?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>“Neyther.”</p>

<p>“Is it possible they have escaped?”</p>

<p>“Jest so, I helped ’em off myself.”</p>

<p>“Thank heaven! Where are they?”</p>

<p>“Down the river at one of the settlements.”</p>

<p>“How far distant is it?”</p>

<p>“A dozen miles, p’raps, though it mought be more, and
then agin it mightn’t.”</p>

<p>“Well, let us then hasten to them, or, let me at least, as I
have nothing to detain me here.”</p>

<p>“I’m willing,” said Seth, moving forward, “but I forgot to
tell you the darter’s ’mong the Indians, I didn’t think of
that.”</p>

<p>Graham started, for, perhaps, the shrewd reader has already
suspected he had more than a passing interest in the fate of
Ina. Visions of a fair childish face <em>had</em> haunted him, and his
perilous journey was owing much to their enchantment. He
had played with her in childhood, and while they were yet
children, they had separated; but they had pledged their hearts
to each other, and looked hopefully forward to a reunion in
later years. Graham had dreamed of this meeting a long time;
and, now that it was so cruelly thwarted, he felt agonized
indeed. Years before, when still a boy, although quite a large
one, he had visited this section, and the memory of that visit
had ever been a bright dream in the past. He mastered his
emotion in a moment, with a strong effort, and asked his companion
calmly&mdash;</p>

<p>“What tribe has captured Ina?”</p>

<p>“Them infarnal Mohawks, I believe.”</p>

<p>“How long ago did it occur?”</p>

<p>“Only a few hours, as you can see by them coals there.”</p>

<p>“Will you be kind enough to give me the particulars?”</p>

<p>“Sartinly.”</p>

<p>And thereupon, Seth proceeded to narrate the incidents
given in the preceding chapter, adding, however, that the parents
and sister were safe. He had accompanied them himself
down to the settlement mentioned, where, leaving them, he
had made all haste back again, and had arrived just in time
to meet Graham. At first he said he mistook him for a savage,
and as he was alone, he came very near shooting him;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
but, as he heard him communing with himself he discovered
at once that he was a white man.</p>

<p>“And what has brought you back here?” asked Graham,
when he had finished.</p>

<p>“That’s a pooty question to ax me, I swow! What has
brought me back here? Why, the same thing, I cac’late as
has brought you&mdash;to find out what is to be found out ’bout
Ina, that purty darter.”</p>

<p>“Ah&mdash;pardon me, friend, I am glad to hear it, and I am
free to confess that that inducement has had more in bringing
me here than any thing else. From your starting alone to
rescue her, I presume you entertained hopes of recovering her,
and, as you, alone, entertained such hopes, I judge there is
greater room for them, when another one joins you.”</p>

<p>“Did I say, stranger, I ’spected to git that gal again?” asked
Seth in a low tone.</p>

<p>“You did not say so in words, it is true; but from <em>what</em> you
said, I judged such was your intention. Was I mistaken?”</p>

<p>“No, sir; that’s what I meant.”</p>

<p>“I see no reason why we should not be friends, as we are
both actuated by a desire to rescue an unfortunate one from
the horrors of Indian captivity, and I trust, without that fact,
we would find nothing distasteful in each other.”</p>

<p>“Them’s my sentiments, ’zactly. Give us your hand.”</p>

<p>The two closed hands with a true friendly grip, and could
each have seen the other’s face in the darkness, he would
have beheld a radiant expression of friendship. They then
retired further into the wood and continued the conversation.</p>

<p>We may remark in this place, that the Indians who had
captured Ina, were, as Seth had remarked, members of the
Mohawk tribe. This tribe itself, was a member of the “Five
Nations,” including with them, the Seneca, Cayuga, Onondaga,
and Oneida tribes, which have become quite famous in
history. They are known among the French as the <em>Iroquois</em>,
and among the Dutch as <em>Maquas</em>, while at home they are
called the Mingoes, or <em>Agamuschim</em>, signifying the <em>United People</em>.
The Mohawks, or <em>Wabingi</em>, first existed separately and
alone. The Oneidas then joined them, and these in turn,
were followed by the Onondagas, Senecas, and Cayugas. In
the beginning of the last century, the Tuscaroras of the South,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
joined them, after which time they took the name of the Six
Nations, although to this day, they are also known as the Five
Nations. Of course, they were all united, and war made upon
one tribe, was made upon all. They were truly a formidable
confederation, and the Revolution testifies to what deeds
they were sufficient when instigated by the British. During
the predatory warfare which long existed upon the Old Frontier,
the white settlers relied mainly upon stratagem to outwit
their foes, and it was by this means alone that Seth Jones
hoped to rescue Ina from their hands.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V"></a>CHAPTER V.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">ON THE TRAIL, AND A SUDDEN DEPARTURE FROM IT BY SETH.</span></h2>


<p>“The Mohawks, you say, have then captured her?” remarked
Graham, after a moment’s pause.</p>

<p>“Yes; I know it’s them.”</p>

<p>“Did you get a glimpse of them?”</p>

<p>“I came up as soon as possible, and they were leaving at
that moment. I saw one or two of them, and know’d it was
them, sure ’nough. Howsumever, that don’t make no difference,
whether it’s the Mohawks, Oneidas, or any of them
blasted Five Nation niggers. They are all a set of skunks,
and one would just as lief run off with a man’s gal, as not.
There ain’t any difference atwixt ’em.”</p>

<p>“I suppose not. The same difficulties would have to be
surmounted in each case. The point is not whether one shall
make an attempt at a rescue, but how shall it be done. I
confess I am in a maze. The Mohawks are an exceedingly
cunning people.”</p>

<p>“That’s a fact, that needn’t be disputed.”</p>

<p>“But then, you know, if we outwit them, we will not be
the first whites who have done such a thing in their day!”</p>

<p>“That’s a fact, too. Now, just hold on a minute, while I
think.”</p>

<p>Graham ceased talking for a moment, while Seth remained
as if in deep and anxious thought. Suddenly lifting up his
head, he remarked.</p>

<p>“I have it.”</p>

<p>“Have what? The plan which must be pursued by us?”</p>

<p>“I cac’late I have.”</p>

<p>“Well, out with it.”</p>

<p>“Why, it’s this. <em>We’ve got to git that gal</em>, an’ no mistake.”</p>

<p>Despite the gloominess which had been upon Graham, he
could not help laughing outright at the serious tone in which
this was uttered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>“What are you laughing at?” indignantly demanded Seth.</p>

<p>“Why, I thought we had arrived at that conclusion long
since.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t think of that; so we did. Howsumever, I’ve
thort further&mdash;hey, what’s that off yonder? ’Nuther building
burning?”</p>

<p>Graham gazed in the direction indicated, and saw that day
was breaking. This he remarked to his companion.</p>

<p>“Yes; so ’tis, and I’m glad of it, for we want some light
on this subject.”</p>

<p>In a short time, the sun appeared above the forest, and
poured a flood of golden light over the woods and streams.
Birds were singing their morning songs in every part of the
wood, and every thing wore as gay a look, as though no deed
of blood had been committed during the night. As soon as
it was sufficiently light, Seth and Graham made their way toward
the stream.</p>

<p>“As we shall shortly start,” remarked the latter, “I will
attend to my horse, which I brought with me. He is not a
short distance away, and I will be back in a moment.”</p>

<p>So saying, he departed in the wood. He found his horse,
completely worn out, asleep upon the ground. He unloosened
his fastening, and as there was abundant provender around, in
the shape of young and tender twigs and luxuriant grass, he
removed the saddle and bridle, and concluded to allow him
free scope of the wood until his return, trusting to the rather
doubtful chances of ever recovering him again. This done,
he returned to his companion.</p>

<p>He found Seth leaning upon his rifle, and gazing meditatively
into the silent stream flowing before him. Graham
looked curiously at him a moment, and then said:&mdash;</p>

<p>“I am ready, Seth, if you are.”</p>

<p>The individual addressed, turned without a word and strode
toward the clearing. When the ruins of the house were
reached, they both halted, and in an undertone, he said:</p>

<p>“Hunt up the trail.”</p>

<p>Each bent his head toward the ground, and moved in a
circle around the clearing. Suddenly Graham paused, and
proceeding quickly several yards in the wood, halted and exclaimed:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>

<p>“Here it is, Seth.”</p>

<p>The latter hastened to his side, and stooping a moment, and
running his eye along the ground, both forward and backward,
replied:</p>

<p>“This is the trail! They ain’t very keerful ’bout it now,
but I reckon it’ll make us open our peepers wider to see it,
after we get into the wood.”</p>

<p>“Well, as the starting point is now reached, we must perfect
our arrangements. You must take the lead in following
this up.”</p>

<p>“Can’t you?” asked Seth, looking up in his eyes.</p>

<p>“Not as well as you. From what little I have seen of you,
I am sure you excel me in the knowledge of the forest. I
have had some experience in fighting, but very little in tracing
a foe through such a wilderness as this.”</p>

<p>“Don’t say? That’s just where you ’n I disagree. I was
always the one to track the tories or red-coats for old Colonel
Allen, and I remember one time&mdash;but I guess I won’t go to
telling stories now, being as I haven’t much time; but I can
say, though pr’aps I oughn’t to, that I can foller any red-skin
as far as he can go, and I don’t care how much pains he takes
to cover up his tracks. You see, if I undertake to foller this,
I’ve got to keep my nose down to the ground, and won’t be
likely to see any danger we’re running into: that’ll have to
be your business. You just hang close to my heels, and keep
yer eyes traveling all over.”</p>

<p>“I’ll endeavor to do my part, although I shall expect some
aid from you.”</p>

<p>“I may give some, as I can tell purty near about when the
imps have gone over the tracks I’m looking at. And now we
must start. I promised Haverland that I wouldn’t show myself
again, until I could tell him something about his darter, and
I swow, I won’t. Come ahead!”</p>

<p>With these words, Seth started ahead on a rapid walk. He
was slightly inclined forward, and his keen gray eye was bent
with a searching look upon the ground. Graham followed
him a few feet distant, with the barrel of his rifle resting in
the hollow of his left arm, while the stock was held in his
right so as to be ready at a moment’s warning.</p>

<p>The signs that led Seth Jones forward were faint, and to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
an ordinary observer, invisible. The Indians, although they
had little fears of pursuit, were yet too cunning and experienced
to neglect any caution that would mislead what enemies
might be disposed to follow them. They traveled in Indian
file, each one stepping in the track of the one before him, so
that, judging from the tracks made, it would appear that but
a single savage had been journeying in these parts. Ina was
compelled to walk in this matter, and more than once when
she inadvertently made a misstep, a cruel blow warned her
of her task.</p>

<p>Sometimes the leaves, as they lay, appeared perfectly devoid
of the slightest depression or disturbance, yet, had one stooped
and carefully scrutinized the ground, he would have seen the
faint outlines of a moccasin defined upon it, or observed that
a leaf had been displaced, or perhaps a slender twig had not
yet recovered the position from which it had been forced by
the passing of human feet. All these were trifling indications,
it is true, yet they were unerring ones to the practiced eye of
the hunter, and as plain as the footprints upon the dusty
roads. Soon Seth paused, and raising his head, turned toward
Graham.</p>

<p>“We are gaining on ’em.”</p>

<p>“Ah&mdash;are we? Glad to hear it. When is it probable we
shall overtake them?”</p>

<p>“Can’t exactly say, but not for a considerable time yet.
They are tramping at a purty good gate, and they only halted
last night to rest Iny now and then. Darn ’em! she’ll wan’t
rest, I cac’late, more’n once afore she’s done with ’em.”</p>

<p>“Can’t you conjecture their number?”</p>

<p>“There’s somewhere in the neighborhood of twenty of the
best warriors of the Mohawks. I can tell that by their tracks.”</p>

<p>“How is that? They make but a single one, do they?”</p>

<p>“Of course not, but I rayther cac’late they make that a
little different, fur all that, from what one would. Are you
hungry?”</p>

<p>“Not at all, I can stand it till noon, without the least inconvenience.”</p>

<p>“So can I; keep a good look-out, and now ahead again.”</p>

<p>With these words, Seth again plunged in to the woods, and
the two prosecuted their journey much as before. The sun<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
was now high in the heavens, and its warm rays pierced the
arches of the forest at many points, and there were golden
patches of light scattered over the travelers’ path. Several
times they crossed small, sparkling streams, where sometimes
could be seen signs of the pursued having slaked their thirst,
and more than once the frightened deer bounded ahead, and
paused and gazed in wonder at them, then leaped away again.
Graham could hardly resist the temptation of bringing one of
them down, especially as he began to feel a desire to taste
them; but he too well knew the danger of risking a shot,
when it might bring down their most mortal enemies in a
moment upon them.</p>

<p>All at once, Seth halted and raised his hand.</p>

<p>“What does this mean?” he asked, gazing off in a side direction
from the trail.</p>

<p>“What is it?” queried Graham, approaching him.</p>

<p>“The trail divides here. They must have separated, though
I can’t see what has made them.”</p>

<p>“Isn’t it a stratagem of theirs to mislead pursuers?”</p>

<p>“I believe it is! Here, you follow the main trail, while I
take the side one, and we’ll soon see.”</p>

<p>Graham did as directed, although it cost him considerable
trouble to perform his part. It proved as they expected. In
a short time, the two trails united again.</p>

<p>“We must look out for such things,” remarked Seth. “I’ve
got to watch the ground closer, and you must look out that I
don’t pitch heels over head into a nest of the hornets.”</p>

<p>They now proceeded cautiously and rapidly forward. About
the middle of the afternoon, they halted beside a stream of
considerable size. Seth produced a quantity of dried venison,
which he had brought with him from the settlement, and of
this they made a hearty meal. This done, they arose and
again proceeded upon their journey.</p>

<p>“See there!” said Seth, pointing to the middle of the
stream. “Do you see that stone there? Notice how it is
marked, and observe that print of a moccasin beside it. One
of their number has slipped off of it. Let us be keerful.”</p>

<p>He stepped into the water, and made his way carefully
across, followed by Graham. When they stepped upon dry
land again, the shades of evening were gathering over the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
forest, and already the birds had ceased their songs. There
was, however, a bright moon,&mdash;in fact, so bright, that they determined
to keep up their pursuit.</p>

<p>The progress was now necessarily tardy, as it required the
utmost straining of Seth’s vision to keep the trail, and had it
not been for the friendly openings in the wood, where it was
as plain as at mid-day, they would have been compelled to
abandon it altogether until the morning. Several times,
Graham was compelled to stand, while Seth, almost on his
hands and knees, searched out the “signs.” They came across
no evidence of the Indians having encamped, and judged from
this, that they either intended reaching their tribe before doing
so, or that they were somewhere in the vicinity. The latter
was the most probable supposition, and prudence, demanded
them to be cautious and deliberate in their movements.</p>

<p>Suddenly Graham noticed the woods appeared to be growing
thinner and lighter in front, as though an opening was at
hand. He called the attention of Seth to this, who remarked
that it was very probable. In a few moments they heard a
noise as of flowing water, and immediately after stood upon
the bank of a large creek, or more properly a river. The
current was quite rapid, yet without much hesitation, they
plunged boldly in and swam across. The night being warm
and moderate, they suffered little inconvenience from their wet
and clinging clothes, as the exercise of walking kept them sufficiently
warm.</p>

<p>As they ascended the bank, they stood upon a vast and
treeless plain over which the trail led.</p>

<p>“Must we cross this?” asked Graham.</p>

<p>“I don’t see any other way. There ain’t any chance to
skirt it, ’cause it appears to run up and down about four thousand
three hundred miles, while you can see the other side.”</p>

<p>This was true&mdash;that is the latter part of his assertion. The
plain before them, from all appearances, was a prairie of great
length, but comparatively narrow breadth. The dark line of
the woods upon the opposite side could be plainly seen, and
did not appear more than a good hour’s walk away.</p>

<p>“I don’t see any other way,” repeated Seth, musingly to
himself. “It’s got to be crossed, although it’s a ticklish business,
I swow!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<p>“Would it be better to wait until morning?” asked Graham.</p>

<p>“Why so?”</p>

<p>“We may walk into danger without seeing it, in the night.”</p>

<p>“And how do you s’pose we’re going to walk over here
in daylight, without being targets for all the Ingins that are a
mind to crack away at us?”</p>

<p>“Can we not pass around it?”</p>

<p>“Stars and garters! hain’t I told you it reaches five thousand
miles each way, and it would take us three years to get
half-way round?”</p>

<p>“I was not aware that you had given me such interesting
information, until just now; but, as such is the case, of
course nothing is left for us but to move forward, without
losing time talking.”</p>

<p>“The trail goes purty straight,” said Seth, turning and looking
at the ground, “and I’ve no doubt it heads straight across
to the other end. Hope so, ’cause it’ll be convenient.”</p>

<p>“You must help me keep watch,” said Graham, “you will
not need to watch the ground all the time, and you will need
to keep a look out elsewhere.”</p>

<p>As might naturally be supposed, our two friends, although
quite experienced backwoodsmen, had miscalculated the distance
to the opposite side of the prairie. It was full midnight,
ere they reached its margin.</p>

<p>All was as silent as death, as they cautiously and stealthily
entered the wood again. Not a breath of wind stirred the
boughs on the tree-tops, and the soft murmur of the river
had long died away into silence. There were a few flying
clouds that obscured the moon at intervals, and rendered its
light uncertain and treacherous. Seth still pressed forward.
They had gone a few hundred yards, when they heard voices!
Cautiously and silently they still picked their way, and soon saw
the light of fire, reflected against the uppermost limbs of the
trees. The fire itself was invisible, although it could not be
far distant. Seth whispered for Graham to remain quiet,
while he moved forward. He then stepped carefully ahead,
and soon reached a massive natural embankment, up which
on his hands and knees he crawled. He peered carefully over
this and saw, down in a sort of hollow, the whole Indian encampment!
There were over twenty gathered around, most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
of whom were extended upon the ground asleep, while several
sat listlessly smoking and gazing into the fire. Seth looked
but a moment, as he knew there were watchful sentinels, and
it was fortunate that he had not been discovered, as it was.
Carefully retreating, he made his way down again to Graham.</p>

<p>“What’s the news?” asked the latter.</p>

<p>“&mdash;sh! not so loud. They’re all there.”</p>

<p>“<em>She</em>, too?”</p>

<p>“I s’pose, though I didn’t see her.”</p>

<p>“What do you intend doing?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. We can’t do nothin’ to-night; it’s too
near morning. If we could git her, we couldn’t get a good
’nough start to give us a chance. We’ve got to wait till to-morrow
night. There’s a lot of ’em on the watch too. We’ve
got to lay low till daylight, and foller ’long behind ’em.”</p>

<p>The two made their way off in a side direction, so as not
to be likely to attract notice in the morning, should any of
the savages take the back trail. Here they remained until
daylight.</p>

<p>They heard the Indians, as soon as it was fully light, preparing
their morning meal; and, as they deemed they could
see them without incurring great peril, they determined to
obtain a glimpse of them, in order to assure themselves
whether Ina was among them or not. Each had suspicion the
company had separated, and that their trail had been overlooked
in the darkness.</p>

<p>Accordingly, the two crept noiselessly to the top. There
was a heavy, peculiar sort of brier growing on the summit of
the embankment, which was fortunately so impenetrable as to
effectually conceal their bodies. Seth pressed against this
and peered over. His head just came above the undergrowth,
and he could plainly see all that was transpiring. Graham,
with an unfortunate want of discretion, placed his arm on
Seth’s shoulder, and <em>gazed over him</em>! Yet singularly enough,
neither was seen. Graham was just in the act of lowering
his head, when the briers, which were so matted together as to
hold the pressure against them like a woven band, gave way,
and Seth rolled like a log down the embankment, directly
among the savages!</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI"></a>CHAPTER VI.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">A RUN FOR LIFE.</span></h2>


<p>When the sad event just chronicled took place, and Seth
made a rather unceremonious entrance into view of the
savages, Graham felt that he too was in peril, and his life
depended upon his own exertions. To have offered resistance
would have been madness, as there were full thirty Indians at
hand. Flight was the only resource left, and without waiting
to see the fate of Seth, our hero made a bound down the
embankment, alighting at the bottom, and struck directly
across the plain, toward the timber that lined the river. He
had gained several hundred yards, when several prolonged
yells told him that he was discovered, and was a flying fugitive.
Casting his eye behind him, he saw five or six Indians
already down the embankment and in full chase.</p>

<p>And now commenced a race of life and death. Graham
was as fleet of foot as a deer, and was well-trained and disciplined,
but his pursuers numbered five of the swiftest runners
of the Mohawk nation, and he feared he had at last found his
match. Yet he was as skillful and cunning as he was sinewy
and fleet of foot. The plain over which he was speeding was
perfectly bare and naked for six or eight miles before him,
while it stretched twice that distance on either hand, before
the slightest refuge was offered. Thus, it will be seen, he took
the only course which offered hope&mdash;a dead run for it, where
the pursuer and pursued possessed equal advantages.</p>

<p>He was pretty certain that his pursuers possessed greater
endurance than himself, and that in a long run he stood small
chance of escape, while in a short race he believed he could
distance any living Indian. So he determined to try the speed
of his enemies.</p>

<p>As he heard their yells, he bounded forward almost at the
top of his speed. The pursuers, however, maintained the
same regular and rapid motion. Graham continued his exertions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
for about half a mile, making such use of his arms and
limbs as to give the impression that he was doing his utmost.
Toward the latter part of the first mile, his speed began to
slacken, and his dangling limbs and furtive glances behind
him, would have convinced any one that he was nigh exhausted.</p>

<p>But this was only a stratagem, and it succeeded as well as
he could have wished. The Indians believed that he had
committed a common and fatal error&mdash;that of calling into play
the utmost strength and speed of which he was master at the
outset, and that he was now wearied out, while they themselves
were just warming into the glow of the chase. Seeing this,
each sent up a shout of exultation, and darted ahead at the
top of his speed, each endeavoring to reach and tomahawk him
before his companion.</p>

<p>But their surprise was unbounded when they saw the fugitive
shoot ahead with the velocity of a race-horse, while his
veins, too, were only filling with the hot blood of exertion.
They saw this and they saw, too, that should such speed continue
long, he would be far beyond their reach, and all now
ran as they never ran before.</p>

<p>We say Graham’s stratagem succeeded. It did, and it gave
him the knowledge he wished. It showed him that he had
met his match! His pursuers, at least one or two of them,
were nearly as fleet as was he; and, although he might distance
them for a time, yet ere half the race was finished he
would inevitably lose the vantage ground!</p>

<p>Could one have stood and gazed upon this race of life, he
would have seen a thrilling scene. Far ahead, over a vast
plain, a fugitive white man was flying, and his swift steady
gait showed that his limbs were well-trained and were now
put to their severest test. As his feet doubled with such quickness
beneath him as to be almost invisible, the ground glided
like a panorama from under them.</p>

<p>Behind were a half-dozen savages, their gleaming visages
distorted with the passions of exultation, vengeance, and doubt,
their garments flying in the wind, and their strength pressed
to its utmost bounds. They were scattered at different distances
from each other, and were spreading over the prairie,
so as to cut off the fugitive’s escape in every direction.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<p>Two Indians maintained their places side by side, and it was
evident that the pursuit would soon be left to them. The
others were rapidly falling behind, and were already relaxing
their exertions. Graham saw the state of things, and it thrilled
him with hope. Could he not distance these also? Would
they not leave him in such a case? And could he not escape
ere he was compelled to give out from exhaustion?</p>

<p>“At any rate I will try, and God help me!” he uttered,
prayerfully, shooting ahead with almost superhuman velocity.
He glanced back and saw his followers, and they seemed
almost standing still, so rapidly did he leave them behind.</p>

<p>But as nature compelled him to again cease the terrific rate
at which he was going, he saw his unwearied pursuers again
recovering their lost ground. The parties now understood
each other. The Indians saw his maneuvers, and avoided the
trap, and kept on in the same unremitting relentless speed,
fully certain that this would sooner or later compel him to
yield; while Graham knew that the only chance of prolonging
the contest rested in his dropping into and continuing his
ordinary speed.</p>

<p>They now sunk into the same steady and terribly monotonous
run. Mile after mile flew beneath them, and still so
exact and similar were their relative rates, that they were
absolutely stationary with regard to each other! The two
Indians now remained alone, and they were untiring&mdash;they
were determined that they should continue to the end!</p>

<p>At last Graham saw the friendly timber but a short distance
from him. The trees seemed beckoning him to their friendly
shelter, and panting and gasping he plunged in among them&mdash;plunged
right ahead till he stood upon the bank of a large,
rapidly-flowing stream.</p>

<p>When the Anglo-Saxon’s body is pitted against that of the
North American Indian, it sometimes yields; but when his
mind takes the place of contestant, it <em>never</em> loses.</p>

<p>Graham gazed hurriedly around him, and in the space of a
dozen seconds his faculties had wrought enough for a lifetime&mdash;wrought
enough to save him.</p>

<p>Throwing his rifle aside, he waded carefully into the stream
until he stood waist deep. Then sinking upon his face, he
swam rapidly upward until he had gone a hundred yards.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
Here he struck vigorously out into the channel, swimming up
stream as well as <em>across</em> it, so as not to reach the bank at a
lower point. The current was very swift, and required an
exhausting outlay of his already fainting frame before he
reached the opposite shore. Here he immediately sprang upon
the shore, ran quickly a short distance down the stream,
making his trail as plain as possible; and then springing into
the stream, swam rapidly upward, remaining as close to the
shore as possible, so as to avoid the resisting current. The
reason of these singular movements will soon be plain.</p>

<p>The shore was lined by thickly overhanging bushes, and
after swimming until he supposed it time for his pursuers to
come up, he glided beneath their friendly shelter, and awaited
for the further development of things. Almost immediately
after, both appeared upon the opposite bank, but at a point
considerably lower down. Without hesitation, they sprang
into the stream and swam across. As they landed, they commenced
a search, and a yell announced the discovery of the
trail. Instantly after, another yell proclaimed their disappointment,
as they lost it in the river.</p>

<p>The savages supposed that the fugitive had again taken to
the water, and had either drowned or reached the other side.
At any rate, they had lost what they considered a certain prey,
and with feelings of baffled malignity they sullenly swam back
again, searched the other side an hour or so, and then took
their way back to their companions.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII"></a>CHAPTER VII.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">THE EXPERIENCE OF SETH.</span></h2>


<p>“By gracious! stars and garters! &amp;c.! &amp;c.! This is a new
way of introducing one’s self!” exclaimed Seth, as he sprawled
out among the savages around the council fire.</p>

<p>The consternation of the Indians at this sudden apparition
among them may well be imagined. The crackling of the
undergrowth above, had aroused them, yet the advent of Seth
was so sudden and almost instantaneous, that ere they could
form a suspicion of the true nature of things, he was among
them. Their habitual quickness of thought came to them at
once. Graham was seen as he wheeled and fled, and as has
been shown, a number sprang at once in pursuit, while a
dozen leaped upon Seth, and as many tomahawks were
raised.</p>

<p>“Now jest hold on,” commanded Seth; “there ain’t any
need of being in a hurry. Plenty time to take my hair. Fact,
by gracious.”</p>

<p>His serio-comical manner arrested and amused his captors.
They all paused and looked at him, as if expecting another
outburst, while he contented himself with gazing at them with
a look of scornful contempt. Seeing this, one sprang forward,
and clenching his hair in a twist, hissed&mdash;</p>

<p>“Oh! cuss Yankee! we burn him!”</p>

<p>“If you know what’s best, ole chap, you’ll take yer paw off
my head in a hurry. Ef you don’t you mought find it rather
convenient to.”</p>

<p>The savage, as if to humor him, removed his hand, and
Seth’s rifle too. Seth gazed inquiringly at him a moment, and
then with an air of conscious superiority, said:</p>

<p>“I’ll lend that to you awhile, provided you return it all
right. Mind, you be keerful now, ’cause that ar gun cost
something down in New Hampshire.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<p>From what has just been written, it will doubtless be suspected
that Seth’s conduct was a part which he was playing.
When thrown into peril by the impatience of his companion,
he saw at once that an attempt at flight was useless. Nothing
was left but to submit to his misfortune with the best
grace possible; and yet there was a <em>way</em> in which this submission
could be effected which would result better for himself
than otherwise. Had he offered resistance, or submitted despairingly,
as many a man would have done, he would doubtless
have been tomahawked instantly. So, with a readiness of
thought, which was astonishing, he assumed an air of reckless
bravado. This, as we have shown, had the desired result thus
far. How it succeeded after, will be seen in the remaining
portion of this history.</p>

<p>Seth Jones was a man whose character could not be read in
an hour, or day. It required a long companionship with him
to discover the nicely shaded points, and the characteristics
which seemed in many cases so opposite. United with a genial,
sportive humor and apparent frankness, he was yet far-seeing
and cautious, and could read the motives of a man almost
at a glance. With a countenance which seemed made
expressly to veil his soul, his very looks were deceptive; and,
when he chose to play a certain <em>role</em>, he could do it to perfection.
Had one seen him when the conversation above recorded
took place, he would have unhesitatingly set him down as
a natural-born idiot.</p>

<p>“How you like to burn, eh, Yankee?” asked a savage,
stooping and grinning horribly in his face.</p>

<p>“I don’t know; I never tried it,” replied Seth with as much
<em>nonchalance</em> as though it was a dinner to which he was referring.</p>

<p>“E-e-e-e! you will try it, Yankee.”</p>

<p>“Don’t know, yet; there are various opinions about that
p’raps. When the thing is did I mought believe it.”</p>

<p>“You, <em>sizzle</em> nice&mdash;nice meat&mdash;good for burn!” added another
savage, grasping and feeling his arm.</p>

<p>“Just please to not pinch, my friend.”</p>

<p>The savage closed his fingers like iron rods, and clenched
the member till Seth thought it would be crushed. But,
though the pain was excruciating, he manifested not the least<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
feeling. The Indian tried again and again, till he gave up and
remarked, expressive of his admiration of the man’s pluck.</p>

<p>“Good Yankee! stand pinch well.”</p>

<p>“Oh! you wan’t pinching me, was you? Sorry I didn’t
know it. Try again, you mought p’raps do better.”</p>

<p>The savage, however, retired, and another stepped forward
and grasped the captive’s hand.</p>

<p>“Soft, like squaw’s hand&mdash;let me feel it,” he remarked,
shutting his own over it like a vice. Seth winced not in the
least; but, as the Indian in turn was about to relinquish his
attempt at making sport for his comrades, Seth said:</p>

<p>“Your paws don’t appear very horny,” and closed over it
with a terrific grip. The savage stood it like a martyr, till
Seth felt the bones of his hand actually displacing, and yielding
like an apple. He determined, as he had in reality suffered
himself, to be revenged, and he closed his fingers tighter
and more rigid till the poor wretch sprang to his feet, and
howled with pain!</p>

<p>“Oh! did I hurt you?” he asked with apparent solicitude,
as the savage’s hand slid from his own with much the appearance
of a wet glove. The discomfited Indian made no reply,
but retired amid the jeers of his comrades. Seth, without moving
a muscle, seated himself deliberately upon the ground, and
coolly asked a savage to lend him a pipe. It is known, that
when an Indian sees such hardihood and power, as their captor
had just evinced, he does not endeavor to conceal his admiration.
Thus it was not strange, that Seth’s impudent request
was complied with. One handed him a well-filled pipe,
with a grin in which could be distinctly seen, admiration, exaltation,
and anticipated revenge. From the looks of the others,
it was plain they anticipated an immense deal of sport.
Our present hero continued smoking, lazily watching the volumes
of vapor, as they slowly rolled before and around him.
His captors sat around him a moment, conversing in their own
tongue (every word of which we may remark, was perfectly
understood by Seth), when one arose and stepped forward before
him.</p>

<p>“White man strong&mdash;him pinch well&mdash;but me make him
cry?”</p>

<p>So saying, he stooped, and removing the captive’s cap<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
seized a long tuft of yellow hair which had its root at the temple.
A stab in the eye would not have caused an acuter
twinge of pain; but, as he jerked it forth by the roots, Seth
gave not the slightest indication, save a stronger whiff at the
pipe. The savages around did not suppress a murmur of admiration.
Seeing no effect from this torture, the tormenter
again stooped and caught another tuft that grew low upon the
neck. Each single hair felt like the point of a needle thrust
into the skin, and as it came forth, the Indians seated around,
noticed a livid paleness, like the track of a cloud, quickly
flash over their captive’s countenance. He looked up in his
tormentor’s eyes with an indescribable look. For a moment,
he fixed a gaze upon him, that savage as he was, caused a
strange shiver of dread to run through him.</p>

<p>To say that Seth cared nothing for these inflicted agonies
would be absurd. Had the savage dreamed what a whirlwind
of hate and revenge he had awakened by them, he would have
never attempted what he did. It was only by an almost unaccountable
power that Seth controlled the horrible pains of
both body and mind, he suffered. He felt as though it was
impossible to prevent himself from writhing on the ground in
torment, and springing at his persecutor and tearing him from
limb to limb. But he had been schooled to Indian indignities,
and bore them unflinchingly.</p>

<p>His temple had the appearance of white parchment with innumerable
bloody points in it, as the blood commenced oozing
from the wound, and his neck seemed as though the skin had
been scraped off! His momentary paleness had been caused
by the sickening pain and the intensest passion. His look at
the savage was <em>to remember him</em>. After the events which have
just transpired, they remained seated a moment in silence. At
last, one who appeared to be the leader, addressed in an undertone,
the Indian whom we have just seen retire from the
post of tormentor. Seth, however, caught the words, and had
he not, it is not probable he would have successfully undergone
the last trying ordeal.</p>

<p>The same savage again stepped forward in the circle before
the helpless captive, and removing the cap which had been replaced,
clinched the long yellow locks in his left hand, and
threw the head backward. Then whipping out his scalping<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
knife, he flashed it a second in the air, and circled its cold edge
around his head with the rapidity of lightning. The skin was
not pierced, and it was only an artifice. Seth never took his
eyes from the Indian during this awful minute.</p>

<p>The tormentor again retired. The savages were satisfied,
but Seth was not. He handed his pipe back, replaced his cap,
and rising to his feet, surveyed for a few seconds the group
around. He then addressed the leader.</p>

<p>“Can the white man now try the red man’s courage?”</p>

<p>The voice sounded like another person’s. Yet the chief noticed
it not, and nodded an assent to the request, while the
looks of the others showed the eagerness and interest they felt
in these dreadful proceedings.</p>

<p>The savage, who had inflicted all this agony, had seated
himself directly beside the chief. Seth stepped to him, and
grasping his arm, pressed it moderately. The Indian gave a
scornful grunt. Seth then stooped and gently took the tomahawk
from his belt. He raised it slowly on high, bent down
till his form was like the crouching panther ready to spring.
The glittering blade was seen to flash as it circled through the
air, and the next instant it crashed clean through the head of
the unsuspecting savage!</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII"></a>CHAPTER VIII.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">AN UNEXPECTED MEETING.</span></h2>


<p>Wearied and exhausted, Graham crawled forth from the
water, and lay down a while to rest himself upon the soft,
velvety carpet of grass. Here, overcome by the terrific strain
which his system had undergone, he fell into a deep and lasting
sleep. When he awoke, the day had far advanced, and
the sun was already past the meridian. After fully awakening,
and fervently thanking Heaven for his remarkable preservation
and escape, he commenced debating with himself upon the
best course for him to pursue. He was now alone in the great
wilderness, and what step should he next take? Should he
endeavor to hunt up his friend Haverland, or should he press
on in the pursuit of the object which had led him thus far?</p>

<p>While these questions were yet unanswered, he mechanically
cast his eye up the river, and started as he saw a small canoe
coming round a bend quite a distance from him. He had just
time to see that there were two beings in it, when prudence
warned him to make himself invisible. He stepped behind
the trunk of a massive king of the forest, and watched with
eager interest the approach of the new-comers. The light
canoe shot rapidly over the placid surface of the river, and in
a few moments was abreast of him. He saw that the two
occupants were white men, and he scanned their countenances
with deep interest. The stronger of the two was seated in
the center of the light vessel, and dipped the ashen blades deep
into the water at every stroke. The other, seemingly an elder
man, was seated in the stern, and while he controlled the
actions of the other, scanned either shore with the experienced
eye of the frontiersman. Graham believed, though he knew
he had been careful, that his presence was suspected, as the
canoe, apparently without any intent of its occupants, sheered
off toward the opposite shore. He remained concealed until<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
it was directly abreast of him, when a sudden suspicion flashed
over him that one of the men was Haverland, although it was
so long since he had seen him that it was impossible to satisfy
himself upon that point without a closer view. However,
they were white men, and he determined to risk the probabilities
of their being friends. In a subdued voice, without coming
into view himself, he called to them. He knew he was
heard, for the man at the oars halted a second, and glanced
furtively toward the shore; but at a slight sign from the other,
he again bent to them, and they both continued, as though
they suspected no danger.</p>

<p>“Hallo, my friends!” called he, in a louder tone, but still
concealing himself. There was no notice, however, taken of
him, save he fancied a quicker propulsion of the boat forward.
He now stepped boldly forth and called,</p>

<p>“Do not be suspicious; I am a friend.”</p>

<p>This brought them to a pause, while the one in the stern
spoke.</p>

<p>“We are not satisfied of that; for what business have you
here?”</p>

<p>“I might with equal justice put that question to you.”</p>

<p>“If you choose to give no answer, we can not wait to bandy
words with you. Go ahead, Haverland.”</p>

<p>“Hold! is that Alfred Haverland with you?”</p>

<p>“Suppose it is? What is that to you?”</p>

<p>“He is the man whom, above all others, I wish to see. I
am Everard Graham; and perhaps he remembers the name.”</p>

<p>The woodman now turned toward the shore with a stare of
wonder. A minute sufficed.</p>

<p>“It’s he, Ned, sure enough.”</p>

<p>With these words he turned the canoe toward shore. A
few strokes sent it up against the bank, and he sprang out and
grasped the hand of his young friend.</p>

<p>“Why, Graham, what in the name of the seven wonders
has brought you here? I forgot, you <em>did</em> promise me a visit
somewhere about this time, but so many other things have
transpired, as to make it slip my mind altogether. And I can
assure you, I have had enough to break the heart of any ordinary
mortal,” he added, in a choking voice.</p>

<p>Explanations were then given; and the wonder, gratitude,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
and apprehension, that followed Graham’s story, may be imagined.
Before these were given, Haverland introduced his
companion, Ned Haldidge.</p>

<p>“Seth promised to bring Ina back,” said he, “but I could
not bear to remain idle while he alone was searching for her.
This good friend, here, who has had much experience in the
border warfare, willingly joined me. I suppose you would
like to see the mother; but if you did, you would see a well-nigh
broken-hearted one, and I can not bear to meet her until
I have learned more of our darling daughter.”</p>

<p>“And if them cowardly Mohawks don’t rue the day they
commenced their infernal work, then Ned Haldidge is mightily
mistaken!” exclaimed that individual, warmly.</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” smiled Graham, “but that with our present
number and present feelings, we might make an open attack
upon them, especially as we have a friend in the camp.”</p>

<p>“No, sir; that’ll never do!” replied the hunter, with a
shake of the head. “They can never be overcome in that
way. We could have brought a dozen men with us who
could have blown the cowards to atoms, but ’twouldn’t do.”</p>

<p>“You then rely wholly upon stratagem, eh?”</p>

<p>“Nothing else will do with <em>them</em> critters.”</p>

<p>“And heaven only knows whether that will,” remarked
Haverland, in a desponding tone.</p>

<p>“Ah! don’t give way, Alf, wait till it’s time.”</p>

<p>“You must pardon my exhibition of weakness,” said he, recovering
himself. “Though I feel the strength of an army in
these limbs of mine, yet I have the heart of a <em>father</em> in this
bosom, and I can do any thing for the recovery of my darling
daughter. Oh! I can hear her screams yet, as she was torn
from us on that night.”</p>

<p>Graham and Haldidge remained silent, respecting his deep
and moving grief. Soon the father spoke again, and this time
his voice and manner were changed.</p>

<p>“But why stand we here idle? Is there nothing for us
to do? Are we to remain desponding, when a single effort
may save her?”</p>

<p>“That’s just what I’ve been thinking ever since we stopped
here,” replied Haldidge. “I don’t see any use in waiting, especially
when there <em>is</em> use in doing something.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>

<p>“Let us depart, then. You will accompany us, of course,
Graham?”</p>

<p>“Certainly; but I should like to inquire your intentions?”
asked he, pausing on the bank a moment, as the others seated
themselves.</p>

<p>“I should think you would remember we can have but one
intention,” answered Haverland, in a tone of slight rebuke.</p>

<p>“That is not exactly what I meant. Of course, I knew
your ultimate intention, but I wished to inquire what course
you intended to pursue.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s it!” replied Haldidge. “I’ve been considerable
among the redskins of this region, and know that they can be
soonest reached by going down the river some distance further&mdash;several
miles below this bend&mdash;and taking the land.”</p>

<p>“But my experience tells me you are mistaken this time.
Ina’s captors are now at no great distance, and the shortest
course to them, you will find, is in a direct line from here,
across the open prairie, the other side the river.”</p>

<p>“At any rate, we will cross to the opposite bank; so step
in.”</p>

<p>“Wait a minute. What does that mean?”</p>

<p>As Graham spoke, he pointed quickly up the river. From
the position of the two within the boat, they could discern
nothing.</p>

<p>“Jump ashore, quick, and pull the boat out of sight.
There’s something a-foot, and you musn’t be seen,” exclaimed
Graham excitedly, in an undertone, as he stooped and grasped
the prow of the canoe. The men sprang ashore, and in an instant
the vessel was hauled up out of sight, while the three
made themselves invisible, and from their hiding-places eagerly
watched the river.</p>

<p>The object which had arrested the attention of Graham, was
a second canoe, which was just making its appearance round
the bend above, which had first brought his friends to view.
This latter one was of about the same size, and could be seen
to hold either three or four persons. The dark-tufted heads
of the occupants, rising like statues in the boat, showed unmistakably
that they were Indians.</p>

<p>As it came nearer and nearer, Haldidge whispered there
was a fourth person in the stern, <em>and she was a female</em>! Haverland<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
and Graham breathed hard, for a wild hope filled the
heart of each, but as the canoe came abreast of them, while
they could plainly distinguish the features of the three savages,
they could not gain a glimpse of the fourth person. She
was covered by an Indian shawl, and her head was bowed
low upon her bosom, as though in deep and painful thought.</p>

<p>“Let us fire and send these three dogs to eternity,” whispered
Graham.</p>

<p>Haldidge raised his hand.</p>

<p>“’Twon’t do, there may be others about, and if that other
one is Ina, it may only be the means of her destruction. Alf,
do you think that is her?”</p>

<p>“I can’t tell&mdash;yes, by heaven, ’tis her! Look! she has
moved her shawl. Let us rescue her at once!” exclaimed the
father, rising, and about to start.</p>

<p>“Hold!” imperatively and half angrily commanded Haldidge,
“you will spoil all by your rashness. Don’t you see it
is near night? They are now below us, and we can not get
them in such a range as to insure us each of them. Wait till
it is darker, and we will pursue them. I have a plan which
I think can not fail. Just restrain yourself a short time, and
I will bring things about in a manner that will surprise them
as much as it will you.”</p>

<p>Haverland sank down again beside the others. The night
was now fast coming on, and in a few minutes the light, birch
canoe was shoved noiselessly into the water, and the three
made ready for the race of life and death.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX"></a>CHAPTER IX.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">THE CHASE.</span></h2>


<p>The night was even closer at hand than our friends suspected.
In the forest, where the withdrawal of the sun was
almost simultaneous with darkness, it came without much
warning. The gloom was already settling over the water, and
Haverland instantly shot the canoe from under the shrubbery
out into the stream. There were rowlocks and oars for a second
person, and Graham took up a couple and joined his
labors with his friend, while Haldidge took the steering oar.
As they passed boldly into the channel, the canoe ahead was
just disappearing around a bend below.</p>

<p>“Come, this won’t do; we musn’t let them keep out of our
sight,” said Haverland, dipping his oars deep into the water.</p>

<p>A heavy darkness was fast settling over the river, and our
friends noted another thing. A thick, peculiar fog, or mist,
such as is often seen of summer nights, upon a sheet of water,
was already beginning to envelop the banks and river. This,
as will be evident, while it would allow the pursuers to approach
the Indian canoe much closer than otherwise, still gave
the latter a much greater chance of eluding them. Haldidge
hardly knew whether to be pleased with this or not.</p>

<p>“It may help us in the beginning, boys, but we’ve got to
hold on till it’s fairly down on us. If the rascals catch a
glimpse of us before, they’ll give us the slip as sure as fate.
Just lay on your oars a few minutes. We can float down with
the current.”</p>

<p>“I allow it’s the best plan, although I am much in favor of
dashing and ending the matter at once,” remarked Graham,
nervously handling his oars.</p>

<p>“And while I think of it,” pursued Haldidge, “I don’t see
as it would do any hurt to muffle the oars.”</p>

<p>Before starting, they had abundantly provided themselves
with means for this and, in a few moments a quantity of cloth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
was forced into the rowlocks, so as to be able to give full
sweep to the oars without making enough noise to attract suspicion
from the shore, unless an ear was listening more intently
than usual.</p>

<p>By this time, too, the thick mist mentioned, had enveloped
the river in an impenetrable cloud, and they shot boldly into
it. The light vessel flew as swiftly and noiselessly as a bird
over the water. Haldidge understood every turn and eddy in
the stream, and guided the canoe with unerring certainty
around the sharp bends, and by the rocks whose black heads
now and then shot backward within a few feet of their side.</p>

<p>In this way a mile was passed when he raised his hand as
a signal for them to cease efforts for a moment.</p>

<p>“Listen!” he uttered.</p>

<p>All did so, and faintly, yet distinctly and distantly, they
heard the almost inaudible dip of oars, and the click of the
rowlocks.</p>

<p>“Is that above or below?” asked Haverland, bending his
head and intently listening.</p>

<p>“I think we have <em>passed</em> them <em>sure</em> enough,” replied Graham.</p>

<p>The sound certainly appeared to come from above them,
and all were constrained to believe that, rowing as swiftly and
powerfully as they did, they must have swept by them in the
darkness without suspecting their proximity.</p>

<p>“Can it be possible?” questioned Haldidge, wonderingly
and doubtingly.</p>

<p>But such was the character of the river-banks at this point,
that all had been deceived in listening to the sounds, and the
Indians were all the time leaving them far behind. It was
not until they heard unmistakably the sounds receding in the
distance, that they became conscious of the true state of matters.
At that moment, as they were dying out, they all heard
them plainly enough far below.</p>

<p>“We might have known it,” said Haldidge in vexation.
“You’ve got to lay to it, to catch them now.”</p>

<p>“But is there not danger of running afoul of them?”</p>

<p>“Not if we are careful. I think they will run into shore
soon, and if so, it will be the eastern bank. I will hug that
closely, and keep my ears open.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>

<p>The two now bent to their oars with redoubled powers.
They dipped the ashen blades deeply, and pulled until they
bent dangerously, while the water parted in foam at its rushing
prow, and spread away in a foamy pyramid behind.</p>

<p>The effect of this was soon apparent. The rattle of the
oars ahead grew plainer and plainer at each stroke, and it
was evident that they were gaining finely. Haverland’s arm
was thrilled with tenfold power, as he felt that he was rushing
to the rescue of his only darling child, and he only wished
he might have the chance to spring upon her abductors and
rend them limb from limb. Graham’s heart beat faster as he
reflected that, perhaps, in a few moments, he should be face to
face with her who had hovered about his pillow in all his visions
for many a night.</p>

<p>Haldidge sat perfectly cool and possessed. He had formed
his plan, and imparted it to the others; it was to pursue the
canoe noiselessly until they were almost upon it, when
the instant they were near enough to distinguish forms, they
would fire upon the Indians, and dash ahead and capture Ina
at all hazards.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>This Haldidge, who has been introduced to notice in this
chapter, was a middle-aged man, who ten years before had
emigrated from the settlements along the Hudson, with a company
which had formed the settlement from which he started,
and where we saw Haverland and his wife and sister safely
domiciled. He was a married man, and his cabin happened
to be upon the outskirts of the village. He joined and led the
whites in several forays against the savages, when the latter
became too troublesome; and, in this way he at last became
a prominent object for the Indian’s hatred. His residence
became known to them, and one dark, stormy night a half-dozen
made a descent upon it. By the merest chance, Haldidge
was in the village at that time, and thus escaped their
malignant revenge. Being disappointed of their principal
prey, they cowardly vented their hatred upon his defenseless
wife and child. When the father returned, he found them
both tomahawked, side by side, and weltering in each other’s
blood. So silently had this onslaught been made that not a
neighbor suspected any thing wrong, and were horror-struck<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
to find that such deadly peril had been so near their own door.
Haldidge took a fearful vengeance upon the destroyers of his
happiness. He succeeded, a couple of years afterward, in discovering
them, and, before six months were over, shot them
all! As may be supposed, his natural aversion to the race,
was intensified by this tragical occurrence, and had become so
distinguished, that his name was as a terror to the savages in
that section. This will account for his readiness in accompanying
Haverland upon his perilous expedition.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>As was said, our friends were rapidly gaining upon the Indian
canoe. At the rate at which they were going, they would
be up to them in the course of a half hour. They were so
close to the shore, as to see the dark line of the shrubbery
along the bank, and several times an overhanging limb brushed
over their heads. Suddenly Haldidge raised his hand again. All
ceased rowing and listened. To their consternation not the
slightest sound was heard. Graham leaned over, and placed
his ear almost to the water, but detected nothing but the soft
ripple of the stream against the roots and dipping branches
along the shore.</p>

<p>“Can it be?” he asked, with a painful whisper, as he raised
his head, “that we have been heard?”</p>

<p>“I do not think so,” replied Haldidge, apparently in as
much doubt as the rest.</p>

<p>“Then they have run into shore, and departed.”</p>

<p>“I fear that has been done.”</p>

<p>“But we have kept so close to the shore, would we not
have seen or heard the boat?”</p>

<p>“Provided they had landed alone. They may have run in
this very minute, and may not be more than a few yards off.”</p>

<p>“If so, we must hear them yet, and it won’t do to slide
down upon them in the manner we are now going or we shall
find ourselves in the same fix we expected to get them in.”</p>

<p>“Very true, and a good suggestion,” remarked Haldidge;
and as he did so, he reached up and caught an overhanging
limb, and held the canoe still.</p>

<p>“Now, boys, if you’ve got ears&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Sh&mdash;! Look there!” interrupted Haverland in an excited
whisper.</p>

<p>Each turned his head, and saw what appeared to be a common<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
lighted candle floating upon the surface of the stream. It
was a small point of light, which at intervals glowed with a
fuller redness, and which for the time completely confounded
our friends. On it came as noiselessly as death, gliding forward
with such a smooth, regular motion as to show that
it was certainly borne by the current.</p>

<p>“What in the name of&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Stop!” cried Haldidge; “that’s the canoe we’re after! It’s
the light of one of their pipes we see. Are your guns ready?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied the two, just loud enough for him to hear.</p>

<p>“Make right toward it, then, and fire the instant you see
your mark. Now!”</p>

<p>At the same instant he released his hold upon the limb, and
the two threw all their force on their oars. The canoe bounded
like a ball directly ahead, and seemed about to cut the
other in twain. A minute after, the shadowy outlines of
three forms could be dimly seen, and the avenging rifles were
already raised, when the beacon-light was suddenly extinguished,
and the Indian canoe vanished as if by magic.</p>

<p>“It’s one of their tricks!” excitedly exclaimed Haldidge.
“Dash ahead! Curse them; they can’t be far off.”</p>

<p>The two dropped their rifles, and again seized the oars, and
Haldidge sheered it abruptly up stream, for he fancied they
had turned in that direction. He bent his head forward, expecting
each moment to see the forms of their enemies loom
up to view in the mist, but he was mistaken; no savages
greeted his anxious vision. He guided his boat in every direction&mdash;across
the stream&mdash;up and down, but all to no purpose.
They had surely lost their prey this time. The Indians
had undoubtedly heard the pursuers&mdash;had muffled their own
oars, and so proceeded as silently as their pursuers.</p>

<p>“Hold a minute!” commanded Haldidge.</p>

<p>As they rested, they listened deeply and intently.</p>

<p>“Do you hear any thing?” he asked, leaning breathlessly
forward. “There! listen again.”</p>

<p>They could distinguish the ripple of water, growing fainter
and fainter, each minute.</p>

<p>“They are below us again, and now for a trial of speed.”</p>

<p>The two needed no more incentives, and for a time the
canoe skimmed over the water with astonishing speed. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
moon was now up, and there were patches in the stream,
where the wind had blown away the fog, and being exposed
to the light, were as clear as midday. Now and then they
crossed such spots, sometimes but a few feet wide, and at
others, several rods. At these times the shore on either hand
were perfectly outlined, and they glided over them with a sort
of instinctive terror, as they felt how easily an enemy might be
concealed.</p>

<p>In crossing one of these, broader than usual, a glimpse of the
Indian canoe showed itself, just disappearing upon the opposite
side. They were not more than a hundred yards apart,
and they bounded toward it with great rapidity. The patches
of light became more frequent, and the fog was evidently disappearing.
Quite a breeze had arisen, which was fast sweeping
it away. Haldidge kept close into the eastern shore, feeling
sure that their enemies would land upon this side.</p>

<p>Suddenly the whole mist lifted from the surface of the
water in a volume, and rolled off into the woods. The bright
moon was reflected a long distance, and the pursuers gazed
searchingly about, fully expecting to see their enemies not a
dozen rods away. But they were again doomed to disappointment.
Not a ripple disturbed the waters, except their
own canoe. The moon was directly overhead, so that there
was not a shadow cast along the banks, sufficient to conceal
the slightest object. The Indians had evidently landed, and
were far distant in the forest.</p>

<p>“It is no use,” remarked Haverland, gloomily, “they are
gone, and we might as well be&mdash;too.”</p>

<p>“It is a sore disappointment,” added Graham.</p>

<p>“And as much so to me as to either of you,” said Haldidge.
“I have an old score against the infernal wretches that will
take many years to wipe out. I hoped to do something toward
it to-night, but have been prevented. There is no use of hoping
more at this time; they have eluded us, that is self-evident,
and we must try some other means. No doubt you are wearied
of body as well as of mind, and don’t fancy particularly
this remaining out in the river here, a shot for any one who
might possess the will; so let us go into shore, have a rest,
and talk over things.” Dispiritedly and gloomily the two
ran the canoe to the bank and landed.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X"></a>CHAPTER X.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">A COUPLE OF INDIAN CAPTIVES.</span></h2>


<p>So sudden, so unexpected, so astounding was the crash of
Seth’s tomahawk through the head of the doomed savage,
that, for a moment after, not an Indian moved or spoke. The
head was nearly cleft in twain (for an arm fired by consuming
passion had driven it), and the brains were spattered over
numbers of those seated around. Seth himself stood a second,
as if to satisfy himself that the work was complete, when he
turned, walked to his seat, sat down, coolly folded his arms,
and <em>commenced whistling</em>!</p>

<p>A second after, nearly every savage drew a deep breath, as
if a load had been removed from his heart; then each looked
at his neighbor, and in the scowling, ridged brows, the glittering
eyes, the distorted visages, the strained breathing
through the set teeth, could be read the fearful intention.
Every face but that of the chieftain’s, was livid with fury. He
alone sat perfectly unagitated. Three Indians arose, and,
grasping their knives, stood before him waiting for the expected
words.</p>

<p>“Touch him not,” said he, with a shake of the head; “him,
no right here.”</p>

<p>As the chief spoke, he tapped his forehead significantly
with his finger, meaning that the prisoner was demented.
The others believed the same, still it was hard to quell the
pent-up fire which was scorching their breasts. But his word
was law inviolate, and without a murmur, they seated themselves
upon the ground again.</p>

<p>Seth, although his eye appeared vacant and unmeaning, had
noted all these movements with the keenness of the eagle. He
knew that a word or sign from the chief would be sufficient
to hack him into a thousand pieces. When he stood before
his inhuman tormentor, with the keen tomahawk in his hand,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
the certainty of instant death or prolonged torture would not
have prevented him taking the savage vengeance he did. Now
that it was over, he was himself again. His natural feelings
came back, and with it the natural desire for life. The words
of the chief convinced him that he was regarded as either insane
or idiotic, and consequently as not deserving death. Still,
although saved for the present, he ever stood in imminent
peril. The fallen savage had living friends, who would seize
the first opportunity to avenge his death. At any rate, let
matters stand as they might, Seth felt that he was in hot
quarters, and the safest course was to get out of them as soon
as possible.</p>

<p>It was perhaps ten minutes after the horrid deed, that the
savages commenced bestirring themselves. Several arose and
carried their comrade to one side, while the others commenced
preparations for taking up the day’s march. At this moment,
the runners who had pursued Graham to the water’s edge,
returned, and the tragical occurrence was soon made known
to them. A perfect battery of deadly gleaming eyes was
opened upon Seth, but he stood it unflinchingly. The Indians
would have relished well the idea of venting their baffled
vengeance upon the helpless captive in their hands; but the
commanding presence of their chief restrained the slightest
demonstration, and they contented themselves with meaning
looks.</p>

<p>One thing did not escape Seth’s notice from the first, and
it was an occasion of wonder and speculation to him. Nothing
could be seen of Ina. In fact, the appearance of things
was such as to lead one to believe that the savages knew
nothing of her. Could it be that he and Graham had been
mistaken in the party? Could some other tribe have made
off with her? Or, had they separated, and taken her in an
other direction? As he ruminated upon these questions, he
became convinced that the last suggested the certain answer.
They could not have mistaken the party, as they had never
lost sight of the trail since taking it; and, moreover, he had
noticed several slight occurrences, since his advent among
them, that satisfied him, beyond a doubt, of the identity of
the party with the one which had descended upon the home
of the woodman. From the caution which the aggressors<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
evidenced in their flight, together with the haste in which it
had been conducted; it was plain they had some fears of
pursuit; and to guard their treasure, a number had left them
at a favorable point, intending to join the main body where
pursuit was not to be expected, or where the pursuers had
been sufficiently misled to warrant it. As he reflected, Seth
was satisfied that this was the only and the true explanation
of her non-appearance at this time.</p>

<p>The preparations were soon completed, and the Indians
commenced moving forward. If Seth had entertained any
doubts of their intentions relating to him, they were soon dispelled
by his experience. It was not at all likely that he
would be reserved as a prisoner, unless they intended to put
him to some use. Accordingly, he found himself loaded down
with an enormous burden, consisting mostly of food, in the
shape of deer’s meat, which the savages had brought with
them. They buried their fallen comrade, without the ceremony
and mourning which might be expected. The North
American Indian rarely gives way to his emotions, except upon
such occasions as the burial of one of their number, a “war
dance,” or something similar, when the whole nest of devilish
passions is allowed free vent. They indulged in no such
ceremonies&mdash;if ceremonies they may be called&mdash;at this time.
A comparatively shallow grave was dug, and into this the
fallen one was placed in an upright position, his face turned
toward the east. His rifle, knives, and all his clothing were
buried with him.</p>

<p>The day was a suffocating one in August, and Seth’s sufferings
were truly great. He was naturally lithe, wiry, and capable
of enduring prolonged exertion; but, unfortunately for him,
the savages had become aware of this and had loaded him accordingly.
Most of the journey was through the forest, where
the arching tree-tops, shut out the withering rays of the sun.
Had they encountered any such open plains, as the one passed
over, near their encampment, Seth would have never lived to
survive it. As it was, his load nearly made him insensible to
pain. A consuming thirst was ever tormenting him, although
he found abundant means to slake it in the numberless rills
which gurgled through the wilderness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<p>“How Yankee like it?” grinned a savage, by his side,
stooping and peering fiendishly into his face.</p>

<p>“First rate; goes nice. Say, you, s’posen you try it?”</p>

<p>“Ugh! walk faster,” and a whack accompanied the word.</p>

<p>“Now, I cac’late I’m going to walk just about as fast as I
darned please, and if you ain’t a mind to wait, you can heave
ahead. Fact, by gracious.”</p>

<p>And Seth did not increase his steps in the least. Toward
noon, he found he should be obliged to have a short rest or
give out entirely. He knew it would be useless to ask, and
consequently he determined to take it without asking. So,
unloosing the cords which bound the pack to his back, he let
it fall to the ground, and, seating himself upon it, again went
to whistling!</p>

<p>“Go faster, Yankee&mdash;you no keep up,” exclaimed one, giving
him a stunning blow.</p>

<p>“See here, you, p’raps you don’t know who it mought be
you insulted in that way. I’m Seth Jones, from New Hampshire,
and consequently you’ll be keerful of tetching me.”</p>

<p>The savage addressed, was upon the point of striking him
insolently to the earth, when the chieftain interfered.</p>

<p>“No touch pale face&mdash;him tired&mdash;rest a little.”</p>

<p>Some unaccountable whim had possessed the savage, as this
mercy was entirely unexpected by Seth, and he knew not how
to account for it, unless it might be he was reserving him for
some horrible torture.</p>

<p>The resting spell was but a breathing moment, however,
and just as Seth had begun to really enjoy it, the chieftain
gave orders for the replacement of the load. Seth felt disposed
to tamper awhile, for the sake of prolonging his enjoyment,
but, on second thought, concluded it the better plan not
to cross the chief who had been so lenient to him thus far.
So, with a considerable number of original remarks, and much
disputation about the placing of the burden, he shouldered it at
last and trudged forward.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Seth was right in his conjectures about Ina. Toward the
latter part of the day, the three Indians who had been pursued
by our other friends, rejoined the main party, bearing her with
them. She noticed her companion in captivity at once, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
no communication passed between them. A look of melancholy
relief escaped her as she became assured that her parents
were still safe, and that only she and her new friend
were left to the sufferings and horrors of captivity. But there
was enough in this to damp even such a young and hopeful
spirit as was hers. Not death alone, but a fate from the sensuous
captors, far worse than death itself, was to be apprehended.
In the future, there was but one Hand that could sustain
and safely deliver them, and to that One she looked for
deliverance.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI"></a>CHAPTER XI.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">STILL IN PURSUIT.</span></h2>


<p>“It seems the devil himself is helping them imps!” remarked
Haldidge as they landed.</p>

<p>“But I trust Heaven is aiding us,” added Haverland.</p>

<p>“Heaven will if we help ourselves, and now as I’m in this
scrape I’m bound to see the end. Look for trail.”</p>

<p>“It’s poor work I’m thinking we’ll make, groping in this
moonlight,” said Graham.</p>

<p>“While there’s life there’s hope. Scatter ’long the bank,
and search every foot of land. I’ll run up stream a ways as
I’ve an idea they landed not fur off.”</p>

<p>The hunter disappeared with these words, and Graham and
Haverland, commenced their work in an opposite direction.
The branches overhanging the water were carefully lifted up,
and the muddy shore examined; the suspicious bending or
parting of the undergrowth was followed by the minutest scrutiny,
and although the heavy darkness was against them, yet
it would have required a most guarded trail to have escaped
their vision. But their efforts were useless; no trail was detected;
and convinced that the savages must have landed
upon the opposite side, they turned to retrace their steps. As
they did so, a low whistle from the hunter reached their ears.</p>

<p>“What does that mean?” asked Graham.</p>

<p>“He has discovered something. Let us hasten.”</p>

<p>“What is it, Haldidge?” asked Haverland as they reached
the hunter.</p>

<p>“Here’s their tracks as sure as I’m a sinner, and it’s my
private opine they ain’t fur off neither.”</p>

<p>“Shall we wait until daylight before we undertake to follow
it?”</p>

<p>“I am much afraid we shall have to, as there may be signs
which we might miss in this darkness. Day can’t be far off.”</p>

<p>“Several hours yet.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, we will make ourselves comfortable until then.”</p>

<p>With these words the trio seated themselves upon the
earth, and kept up a low conversation until morning. As
soon as the faint light appeared, they detected the Indian canoe
a short distance up the bank, secreted beneath a heavy, overhanging
mass of undergrowth. As it was during the summer
season, their pursuit was continued at an early hour, so the
savages could have had but a few hours start at the most.
With Ina they could not proceed very rapidly, and our friends
were sanguine of overtaking them ere the day closed.</p>

<p>The only apprehension the pursuers felt, was that the three
savages, fully conscious now that their enemies were upon
their trail, might hasten to rejoin the main body, and thus cut
off all hope. They could not be many miles apart, and must
have made some preparation for this contingency.</p>

<p>The trail to the hunter’s eye was distinct and easily followed.
He took the lead, striding rapidly forward, while
Haverland and Graham were continually on the look-out for
danger. Haverland was somewhat fearful that the savages,
finding they could not avoid being overtaken, would halt and
form an ambush into which the hunter would blindly lead
them. The latter, however, although he appeared culpably
rash and heedless, understood Indian tactics better; he knew
no halt would be made until the savages were compelled to
do so.</p>

<p>“Ah!&mdash;see here!” exclaimed Haldidge, suddenly pausing.</p>

<p>“What’s the trouble?” queried Graham, stepping hastily
forward with Haverland.</p>

<p>“Their camping ground, that is all.”</p>

<p>Before them were more visible signs of the trail than they
had yet witnessed. A heap of ashes were upon the ground;
and, as Haverland kicked them apart, he discovered the embers
still red and glowing. Sticks were broken and scattered
around, and all the varied evidences of an Indian camp were
to be seen.</p>

<p>“How long ago was this place vacated?” asked Graham.</p>

<p>“Not three hours.”</p>

<p>“We must be close upon them.”</p>

<p>“Rather, yes.”</p>

<p>“Let us hasten forward then.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>

<p>“You see by these coals that they didn’t start until daylight;
and as that gal of yourn, Haverland, can’t travel very
fast, of course they’ve had to take their time.”</p>

<p>“Very true; although disappointment has attended us thus
far, I begin to feel a little of my natural hope return. I trust
that this opportunity will not escape us.”</p>

<p>“Ah! more signs yet,” exclaimed Graham, who had been
examining the ground for several yards around.</p>

<p>“What now?”</p>

<p>“That’s a piece of her dress is it not?”</p>

<p>And he held up small, fluttering rag in his hands. The
father eagerly took it, and examined it.</p>

<p>“Yes; that is Ina’s; I hope no violence has placed it in
our hands,” and several involuntary tears coursed down his
cheek at the allusion.</p>

<p>“I’m thinking she left it there on purpose to guide us,” remarked
Graham.</p>

<p>“Shouldn’t wonder at all,” added Haldidge.</p>

<p>“She must have seen us, of course, and has done all she
could to guide us.”</p>

<p>“Very probable; but it strikes me rather forcibly that we
are gaining nothing in particular by remaining here. Remember
the savages are <em>going</em> all the time.”</p>

<p>Thus admonished, the three set rapidly forward again, the
hunter taking the lead as before. The pursuit was kept up
without halting until near noon. Conscious that they were
rapidly gaining upon the fugitives, it was necessary to proceed
with the extremest caution. The breaking of a twig, the falling
of a leaf, startled and arrested their steps, and not a word
was exchanged except in the most careful whisper. Haldidge
was some dozen yards in advance, and the eyes of his companions
were upon him, when they saw him suddenly pause
and raise his hand as a signal for them to halt. They did so,
and stooping downward, he commenced examining the leaves
before him. A moment sufficed. He turned and motioned
his two companions forward.</p>

<p>“Just as I feared,” he moodily exclaimed in a half whisper.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” asked Haverland anxiously.</p>

<p>“<em>The two trails join here</em>,” he answered.</p>

<p>“Are you not mistaken?” asked Haverland, knowing that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
he was not, and yet catching at the faintest hope held out
to him.</p>

<p>“No, sir; there’s no mistake. Instead of three Indians,
we’ve got over forty to follow up now.”</p>

<p>“Shall we do it?”</p>

<p>“Shall we do it? of course we shall; it’s the only chance
of ever getting a sight of Ina again.”</p>

<p>“I know so, and yet the hope is so faint; they must know
we are in pursuit, and what can we do against ten times our
number?”</p>

<p>“No telling yet; come, strike ahead again.”</p>

<p>With these words, the hunter turned and plunged deeper
into the forest. Graham and Haverland silently followed, and,
in a few moments, the three were proceeding as carefully and
silently as before through the dense wood.</p>

<p>As yet our friends had partaken of nothing, and began to
experience the pangs of hunger; but, of course, in the present
instance these were disregarded. Somewhere near the middle
of the afternoon, they came upon another spot where the savages
had halted. Here, if Haverland and Graham had any
lingering doubts of what the hunter had said, they were soon
removed. It was plain that a large Indian party had halted
upon this spot but a few hours before, and it was equally evident
that they had taken no pains to conceal the traces they
had made. If they had any suspicions of pursuit, they had no
apprehensions of the consequences, as they were well aware
of the disparity between the two forces, and scorned the
whites.</p>

<p>This was gratifying on the other hand to the hunter. He
knew well enough that as matters stood at present, he could
hope for nothing except through his own cunning and stratagem;
and, for this reason, it was very probable the Indians
were satisfied no attempt would be made. They did not take
into consideration the fact that there was an enemy in their
camp.</p>

<p>Considerable remains of the meal were discovered, and
served to satisfy the wants of our friends for the present. The
early time in the afternoon showed them that thus far they
had gained quite rapidly upon the savages. It was the earnest
wish of the three that they should come up to the Indian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
party by nightfall; but this expectation was doomed to a sudden
disappointment; for in a few hours they reached a point
where the trail <em>divided again</em>.</p>

<p>This was unaccountable even to the hunter, and for a few
moments our friends stood perfectly nonplussed. They had
not looked for this, and had not the slightest reason of it.</p>

<p>“This beats all creation!” remarked Haldidge, as he again
examined the trail.</p>

<p>“Depend upon it there is something meant in this,” observed
Haverland with an air of deep concern.</p>

<p>“It is some stratagem of the imps which we must understand
before going further.”</p>

<p>“They must entertain different ideas of us from what we
thought. You may safely believe that this is some plan to
mislead us, and if there is ever a time when our wits shall be
demanded it has now come.”</p>

<p>During this fragmentary conversation, the hunter was minutely
examining the trail. Graham and Haverland watched
him a few seconds in silence, when the latter asked:</p>

<p>“Do you make any thing of it?”</p>

<p>“Nothing more. The trail divides here; the main body
proceeds onward in a direct line, while the minor trail leads
off to the west. The division must have been very unequal,
for as near as I can judge the smaller party does not number
over three or four at the most. No efforts have been made to
conceal their traces, and there is either a deep laid scheme
afloat, or they don’t care a fig for us.”</p>

<p>“Very probably both,” remarked Graham. “They care
enough for us to take good care to remain out of our reach,
when they do not possess advantages over us, and have already
shown their skill in not only laying but in executing
schemes.”</p>

<p>“If we could only give that Seth Jones an inkling of our
whereabouts and intentions, I should feel pretty sanguine
again,” said Haverland.</p>

<p>“Very likely if that Jones could give us an inkling of his
whereabouts and experiences, you would lose a little of that
expectation,” rejoined the hunter with a meaning emphasis
and look.</p>

<p>“But this is a waste of time and words,” said Graham, “let<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
us lay our heads together and decide at once what is to be
done. As for me, I’m in favor of following the smaller party.”</p>

<p>“What give you that idea?” asked Haverland.</p>

<p>“I confess that I cannot give much reason for the notion,
but somehow or other it has struck me that Ina is with the
smaller party.”</p>

<p>“Hardly probable,” returned Haverland.</p>

<p>“It don’t seem so, I allow,” remarked the hunter; “but
queerly enough the same notion has got into my head.”</p>

<p>“Of course you can then give some reason.”</p>

<p>“I can give what appears to have a show of reason to me.
I have been doing a big amount of thinking for the last few
minutes, and have almost reached a conclusion. I believe
that the gal is with the smaller party, and it is the wish of the
savages that we shall follow the main body. We will thus be
drawn into ambush, and all further trouble from us will be removed.”</p>

<p>“It seems hardly probable that the savages would run such
a risk of losing their captive when there is no occasion for it,”
remarked Haverland.</p>

<p>“It don’t seem probable, but it ain’t the first thing they’ve
done (providing of course they’ve done it), that would make you
open your eyes. I believe these Mohawks are certain we
won’t suspect they’ve let the gal go off with two or three of
their number when there were enough to watch her and keep
her out the hands of a dozen such as we are. Feeling certain
of this, I say they have let her go; and being sure also that
we’ll tramp on after them, they have made arrangements some
distance away from here to dispose of us.”</p>

<p>“Sound reasoning, I admit, but here’s something to offer
upon the other side,” said Graham producing another fluttering
rag from a bush.</p>

<p>“How is that upon the other side of the question?” queried
the hunter.</p>

<p>“If you will notice the bush from which I took this, you
will see it is upon the trail of the larger party, and consequently
Ina must have been with that party to have left it
there.”</p>

<p>“Just show me the exact twig from which you took it,”
quietly asked Haldidge. Graham led the way a few yards off<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
and showed him the spot. The hunter stooped and carefully
examined the bush.</p>

<p>“I’m now satisfied,” said he, “that I was right. That rag
was left there by a savage for the express purpose of misleading
us. We must seek Ina in another direction.”</p>

<p>“Haldidge,” said Haverland earnestly, “I place great reliance
upon your skill and judgment, but it strikes me at this
moment that you are acting capriciously against reason.”</p>

<p>“There’s but one way to decide it; will you agree to it?”
asked the hunter smilingly. The other two expressed their
willingness, and he produced his hunting knife. For fear that
some of our readers may be apprehensive of the use to which
he intended putting it, we will describe his <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">modus operandi</i> at
once. Stepping back a pace or two, the hunter took the point
of his knife between his thumb and fore finger, and flung it
over his head. As it fell to the earth again, the point was
turned <em>directly toward the trail of the lesser party</em>.</p>

<p>“Just what I thought,” remarked the hunter with another
quiet smile. The mooted question was now settled to the satisfaction
of all, and our three friends turned unhesitatingly to
the westward upon the trail of the smaller party.</p>

<p>How much sometimes hangs upon the slightest thread!
How small is the point upon which great events often turn!
The simple fact of the direction in which the blade of the
hunting knife remained when it fell, decided the fate of every
character in this life drama. Had it pointed to the northward,
an hour later the three would have walked into an ambush
intended for them, and every one would have been massacred.
The hunter was right. Ina Haverland had gone with the
smaller party.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XII" id="CHAPTER_XII"></a>CHAPTER XII.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">PENCILINGS BY THE WAY.</span></h2>


<p>We have said the hunter was right. By the accidental
turning of the hunting knife, he had not only been saved his
life, but his efforts had been turned in the right direction.</p>

<p>It must be confessed that Haverland himself had some misgivings
about the course which they were taking. He could
not believe that the savages were short-sighted enough to
place a captive which was secure in their possession, into the
hands of one or two of their number, when they were conscious
they were pursued. But the decision of the hunting
knife could not be appealed from, and in a moody silence he
followed in the footsteps of the hunter.</p>

<p>It was now getting far along in the afternoon, and the pursued
savages could be at no great distance. Their trail was
plain, as no efforts had been made to conceal it; but, although
Haldidge strove his utmost to detect signs of Ina’s delicate
moccasin, he failed entirely; and was compelled, in spite of
the assurance which he manifested at the start, to take some
misgivings to himself.</p>

<p>The hunter, notwithstanding the consummate cunning and
skill he had shown thus far in tracing up the savages, had
made one sad mistake. He had been misled altogether in the
number of the smaller party. Instead of three or four Indians,
there were six; and, as their trails became visible at
intervals, he began to think he had undertaken a more difficult
matter than he anticipated. Still, it was no time for halting
or faltering, and he strode resolutely forward.</p>

<p>“Ah&mdash;some more signs,” exclaimed he, stopping suddenly.</p>

<p>“What are they?” queried his companions eagerly.</p>

<p>“Just notice this bush, if you please, and tell me what you
make of it.”</p>

<p>The two friends did so, and saw that one of the branches
of some sprouts of chestnut, growing round a stump, had been
broken short off, and lay pointing toward the trail.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>

<p>“I make it favorable. Ina has done this to guide us,” said
Haverland.</p>

<p>“My opinion exactly,” added Graham.</p>

<p>“You are mistaken about one thing. <em>Ina did not do it.</em>”</p>

<p>“Did not do it?” exclaimed the others; “and who did
then?”</p>

<p>“That’s the question. I’m of the opinion that that white
man you have told me about, has done it.”</p>

<p>“But it can not be that he is with them, too.”</p>

<p>“Surely it is impossible that the Indians would allow <em>both</em>
of their captives to be in charge of two or three of their number
at the same time.”</p>

<p>“As for two or three, there are six painted Mohawks ahead
of us for that matter. I haven’t detected the trail of the gal
yet, but have discovered several times pretty convincing evidence
that a white man is among them. If you will look at
that stick again, you will see that it is not likely your gal
broke it. In the first place I don’t believe she is able; for
notice how thick it is; and, if she could have done it, it would
have taken so much time, that she would have been prevented.”</p>

<p>“Very probably Seth is among them, although it is singular
to say the least. Some unaccountable whim has taken possession
of the Indians.”</p>

<p>“But you say you discern nothing of Ina’s trail?” asked
Graham.</p>

<p>“Not as yet.”</p>

<p>“Do you think she is among them?”</p>

<p>“I do.”</p>

<p>“Where is her trail then?”</p>

<p>“Somewhere on the ground, I suppose.”</p>

<p>“Well, why have we not seen it, then?”</p>

<p>“I suppose, because it has escaped our eyes.”</p>

<p>“A good explanation,” smiled Graham, “but if we have
failed altogether thus far to detect it, is it probable that she is
among them?”</p>

<p>“I think so. You must remember that these half dozen
Mohawks are walking promiscuously and not in Indian file, as
is generally their custom. It is very probable that the gal is
in front, and what tracks her little moccasins might make
would be entirely covered up with the big feet of the Ingins.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>

<p>“I hope you are not mistaken,” remarked Haverland, in
such a tone as to show that he still had his lingering doubts.</p>

<p>“That matter can not be decided until we get a peep of the
dusky cowards, and the only course is for us to push ahead.”</p>

<p>“It strikes me that they can be at no great distance, and if
we are going to come upon their camp-fire to-night, we have
got to do it pretty soon.”</p>

<p>“Come on, then.”</p>

<p>With this, the hunter again strode forward, but with more
stealth and caution than before. He saw in the different signs
around them unmistakable proof that the Indians were at no
great distance.</p>

<p>Just as the sun was setting, the triumvirate reached a small
stream which dashed and foamed directly across the trail.
They halted a moment to slake their thirst, and the hunter
arose and moved forward again. But Graham made it a
point to search at every halting place for guiding signs, and
he called out to his companions to wait a moment.</p>

<p>“Time is too precious,” replied he, “and you won’t find
any thing here.”</p>

<p>“Won’t find any thing here, eh? Just come and look at
this.”</p>

<p>The hunter stepped back over the stones in the brook, and
with Haverland approached Graham. The latter pointed to a
broad, flat stone at his feet. Upon it was scratched, with
some softer stone, the following words:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><em>“Hurry forward. There are six Indians, and they have got
Ina with them. They don’t suspect you are following them, and
are hurrying up for the village. I think we will camp two or
three miles from here. Make the noise of the whipporwil when
you want to do the business, and I will understand.</em></p>

<p class="ir1"><span style="padding-right:2em"><em>Yours, respectfully</em>,</span><br />
<span class="smcap">Seth Jones</span>.”</p></div>

<p>“If I warn’t afraid the imps would hear it, I would vote
three cheers for that Jones,” exclaimed Haldidge, “he’s a
trump whoever he is.”</p>

<p>“You may depend upon that,” added Graham, “for what
little I saw of him was sufficient to show me that.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<p>“Let me see,” repeated the hunter, again reading the writing
upon the stone, “he says they will encamp two or three
miles from here. The sun has now set, but we shall have
light for over an hour yet, sufficient to guide us. It’s best for
us to be moving forward, as there is no time to spare.”</p>

<p>“It beats my time how that Jones got into this crowd,”
said Graham, half to himself, as the three again moved forward.</p>

<p>“He’s <em>there</em>, we know, and that is enough for the present;
when we have the time to spare, we may speculate upon the
matter. All ready.”</p>

<p>“Yes,&mdash;but a moment. Haldidge, let us have some arrangement
about the manner in which we are going to travel.
Double caution is now necessary.”</p>

<p>“I will keep my eyes upon the trail, as I have done all
along, and see that we don’t walk into a hornet’s nest, with
our eyes shut. You can help keep a look-out, while you,
Graham, who have been so lucky thus far in stumbling upon
what neither of us saw, will watch for more signs. Just as
like as not, that Jones has been clever enough to give us some
more good directions.”</p>

<p>Each understanding his duty, now prepared to fulfil it.
The progress was necessarily slow, from the extreme caution
exercised.</p>

<p>The hunter had proceeded but a short distance, when he
noticed his shadow was cast upon the ground; and, looking
up, saw to his regret, that the full moon was in the heavens.
This was unfortunate for them; for, although it discovered the
trail with as much certainty as in the day, and thus assisted
them in the pursuit; yet the chances of their approach being
made known to the Indians, was almost certain.</p>

<p>“Hist!” suddenly called Graham, in a whisper.</p>

<p>“What’s up now?” asked the hunter, turning stealthily
around.</p>

<p>“Some more writing from Seth.”</p>

<p>Haverland and Haldidge approached. Graham was stooping
beside a flat stone, endeavoring to decipher some character
upon it. The light of the moon, although quite strong,
was hardly sufficient. By dint of patience and perseverance,
they succeeded in reading the following:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<em>Be</em> <span class="smcap">VERY</span> <em>careful. The imps begin to suspect; they have
seen me making signs, and are suspicious. They keep a close
watch on the gal. Remember the signal, when you come up with
us. Yours, in haste, but nevertheless with great respect.</em></p>

<p class="ir1"><span class="smcap">Seth Jones, Esq.</span>”</p></div>

<p>It was now evident that they were in close proximity to
the savages. After a moment’s hurried debate, it was decided
that Haldidge should walk at a greater distance ahead than
heretofore, and communicate instantly with his companions,
upon discovering the camp.</p>

<p>Slowly, silently, and cautiously the three moved forward.
A half-hour later, Graham touched the shoulder of Haverland,
and pointing meaningly ahead. A red reflection was seen in
the branches overhead; and, as they stood in silence, the
glimmer of a light was seen through the trees. The next instant,
the hunter stood beside them.</p>

<p>“We’ve come on to them at last;” he whispered, “see that
your priming is all right, and make up your mind for hot
work.”</p>

<p>They had already done this, and were anxious for the contest
to be decided. Their hearts beat high, as they realized
how near the deadly conflict was, and even the hunter’s breath
was short and hurried. But there was no faltering or wavering,
and they moved stealthily forward.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIII" id="CHAPTER_XIII"></a>CHAPTER XIII.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">SOME EXPLANATIONS.</span></h2>


<p>The village of the Mohawks was at a considerable distance
from the spot where had once stood the home of the woodman&mdash;and
encumbered as they were with plunder, their progress
was necessarily slow; besides, knowing full well that
pursuit would be useless upon the part of the whites, there
was no occasion to hasten their steps. When, however, Seth
Jones’ unceremonious entrance among them, together with the
escape of his new companion, and the subsequent report of
the smaller party with Ina, was made known, the old chief
began to have some misgiving about his fancied security. It
occurred to him that there might be a large party of whites
upon the trail, and in such a case, his greatest skill was required
to retain the captives. And here was the trouble. If
he was pursued&mdash;and upon that point there could be no
doubt&mdash;his progress must be hastened. His pursuers would
follow with the swiftness of vengeance. With the plunder in
their possession, the thing was impossible, and he saw, at
length, that stratagem must be resorted to.</p>

<p>He selected six of his bravest and fleetest warriors&mdash;two of
whom had been Graham’s most troublesome enemies in his
fearful chase&mdash;and placed Ina in their charge, with instructions
to make all haste to the Indian village. Before starting, it occurred
to him that the best plan would be to send the white
man also with them. Were he to remain with the larger
party in case of attack, his presence, he had reason to fear,
would be their own destruction, while six savages surely armed
and ever vigilant, could surely guard an unarmed idiot and a
woman.</p>

<p>The chief as stated, was well satisfied that he was pursued.
Hence, if he could throw his pursuers off the scent, their discomfiture
would be certain. He believed this could be done.
How well he succeeded, has already been shown. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
six savages with their charge parted from the larger company,
and struck off rapidly in a direction diverging to
the north. Their trail was so concealed as to give the impression
that there were but three of them, and this deception
we have seen misled the hunter. A piece of Ina’s dress was
purposely lodged upon a bush, in the rear of the larger party;
and promiscuously and hopefully, the chief leisurely continued
his way with his dusky followers.</p>

<p>After the parties had parted company, the smaller one hastened
rapidly forward. Ina, in charge of a stalwart, athletic
Indian was kept to the front, the more effectually to conceal
her trail, while Seth kept his position near the centre of the
file. He was allowed the free use of his hands, though, as
has been remarked, he was deprived of his weapons. As
they journeyed hastily forward, he made it a point to enlighten
them as much as possible by his conversation, and certainly
original remarks.</p>

<p>“If you have no objection, I wouldn’t mind knowing your
idea in thus leaving the other Injins, eh?” he remarked, quizzically
of the savage in front. No reply being given, he continued:</p>

<p>“I s’pose you’re thinking about that house you burnt down,
and feeling bad&mdash;Oh, you ain’t, eh?” suddenly remarked Seth,
as the Indian glared fiercely at him.</p>

<p>“It was a bad trick, I allow,” he continued, “enough to
make a feller mad, I swow. That house, I shouldn’t wonder
now, took that Haverland a week to finish; ’twas an ugly
piece of business&mdash;yes, sir.”</p>

<p>At intervals, the savages exchanged a word with each other,
and once or twice, one of them took the back trail, evidently
to ascertain whether they had any pursuers. Finding they
had not, they slackened their speed somewhat, as Ina had
given signs of fatigue, and they believed there was really no
occasion for hastening. But the weariness which the fair
captive had endured, so increased, that long before the sun
had reached its meridian, they halted for a half-hour’s rest.
This was at the crossing of a small, sparkling stream. As
the sun was now quite hot, and the atmosphere thick and
heavy, the rest in the cool shadows of the trees was doubly
refreshing. Ina seated herself upon the cool moist earth, her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
captors preserving, singularly enough, a far more vigilant watch
over her than over Seth Jones; but, for that matter, the latter
was allowed no very special freedom. A couple of Indians
again took the back-trail for prudent reasons, but met with
nothing to excite their apprehensions.</p>

<p>In the mean time, Seth continued tumbling over the ground,
occasionally giving vent to snatches of song, and now and
then a sage remark. Without being noticed, he picked a
small chalky pebble from the margin of the brook, and working
his way to a large flat stone, executed, with many flourishes,
the writing to which we referred in a preceding chapter.
Although cleverly done, this latter act did not escape the eyes
of the suspicious savages. One immediately arose, and walking
to him, pointed down and gruffly asked:</p>

<p>“What, that?”</p>

<p>“Read it fur yourself,” replied Seth innocently.</p>

<p>“What, that?” repeated the savage, menacingly.</p>

<p>“A little flourishing I was executing, jist to pass away
time.”</p>

<p>“Ugh!” grunted the Indian, and dipping his big foot in
the brook, he irreverently swept it across the stone, completely
wiping out Seth’s beautiful chirography.</p>

<p>“Much obliged,” said the latter, “saved me the trouble. I
can write on it again when it gits dry.”</p>

<p>But no opportunity was given, as a moment after the scouts
returned, and the line of march was taken up. But Seth well
knew he had accomplished all that could be desired. He had
taken particular pains that the pebble should be flinty enough
to scratch into the soft stone every word that he wrote. Consequently,
the party had not been gone a half-hour, when every
letter came but as clear and distinct as before, despite the wet
daub the indignant savage had given it.</p>

<p>Their progress for a time was quite rapid. Seth, somehow
or other, was constantly pitching out of file, breaking down
the twigs along the way, stumbling against the stones which
were not in the way, and, in spite of the menaces and occasional
blows of his captors, making the trail unnecessarily distinct
and plain.</p>

<p>At noon, another halt was made, and all partook of some
food. Ina was sick at heart, and ate but a mouthful. An<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
apprehension of her dreadful position came over her, and her
soul reeled as she began picturing what was yet to come. Seth
quarreled with two of his captors, because, he affirmed, they
took more than their share of the dinner; and, take it all in
all, affairs were getting into as interesting a state as one could
well conceive.</p>

<p>The meal finished, they again set forward. From the whispered
consultation of the savages, as well as the words which
reached Seth’s ears, and their utter disregard of Ina’s painful
fatigue, he began to believe that the Indians suspected that
their stratagem had not misled their pursuers, and were apprehensive
of pursuit. Finally, Seth became satisfied that such
was the case, and when they halted toward the middle of the
afternoon, he again gave vent to his thoughts upon a friendly
stone which offered itself, and this, again, received a fierce
wipe from the foot of the same savage, and the words again
came out to view, and accomplished all that their ardent
author could have desired.</p>

<p>These acts of Seth, settled the suspicions of his captors into
a certainty, and a closer surveillance was kept upon their refractory
captive. No further opportunities were given him,
and as he himself had expected this turn of matters, there was
need for it upon his part. Although he had little reason to
hope it, he did hope and believe that Haverland and Graham
were upon the trail, and he felt that if the words intended for
their eyes could only reach them, the fate of Ina and himself
was determined.</p>

<p>The moon being at its full, and shining in unclouded splendor
upon the forest, so lightened the way that the savages continued
their flight&mdash;as it may now be well called&mdash;for an hour
or two in the evening. They would have probably gone
farther, had it not been painfully evident that Ina was ready
to give out. The old chief had given them imperative commands
not to hasten her too much, and to rest when they saw
she needed it. Accordingly, though they were brutal enough
to insult her with menaces, they were of no avail, and, finally,
they came to a reluctant halt for the night.</p>

<p>It will be necessary to understand the situation of these
savages and their captives, in order to comprehend the events
that followed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

<p>A fire was started, and just within the circle of this, half-reclining
upon the ground was Ina, with a heavy Indian shawl
thrown around her. She had partaken of none of the food
offered, and was already in a semi-conscious state. On either
side of her was seated a vigilant savage, well armed and prepared
for any emergency. Upon the opposite side was Seth,
his feet firmly lashed together, while his hands were free.
Two Indians were upon his right, and one upon his left. The
remaining one took his station about a hundred yards on the
back-trail.</p>

<p>Here, lying flat on his face, he silently waited for the approach
of the enemy.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIV" id="CHAPTER_XIV"></a>CHAPTER XIV.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">IN THE ENEMY’S CAMP.</span></h2>


<p>The savages, after starting the fire, allowed it to smolder
and die out, for fear of guiding their enemies. Now this was
the most fortunate thing that could have happened for their
pursuers; for, in the first place, it burned long enough to give
them a perfect knowledge of the position of Ina and Seth;
and, when its light could no longer be of any assistance, but
would materially injure their hopes, the Indians were kind
enough to let it fade entirely out.</p>

<p>Before giving the signal, the hunter deemed it best to ascertain
the whereabouts of the savage missing at the camp-fire.
Leaving his rifle in the charge of Haverland, and cautioning
them not to move, he crept stealthily forward. So
silent and snake-like was his approach, that the savage lying
directly in his path had not the slightest suspicion of his proximity.
The first thing that attracted his attention was the
<em>thought</em> that he heard a slight movement in front of him.
Raising his head a few inches, he peered cautiously forward.
Nothing meeting his keen vision he sunk back again.</p>

<p>The hunter and savage, both being on the ground, were in
blank darkness, and although their forms, if standing on their
feet, would have been plainly discernible, yet under the thick
shadows of the undergrowth, they might have touched each
other without knowing it. The hunter, however, as he lay,
caught the outlines of the savage’s head against the fading light
of the fire behind him, as he raised it. This gave him a knowledge
of his position and determined his own mode of action.</p>

<p>Without the least noise, he slid slowly forward until he was
so close that he could actually hear the Indian’s breath. Then
he purposely made a slight movement. The Indian raised his
head, and was gradually coming to his feet, when the hunter
bounded like a dark ball forward, clutched him by the throat,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
and bearing him like a giant to the earth, drove his hunting
knife again and again to the hilt in his heart. It was a
fearful act, yet there was no hesitation upon the hunter’s part.
He felt that it must be done.</p>

<p>He loosened his grip upon his victim’s throat, when there
was not a spark of life left. Then casting his body to one
side, he made his way back to his companions. Here, in a
few words, he explained what had taken place. It was evident
that the Indians were so cautious and alarmed, that the
most consummate skill was required, to accomplish the work
in hand.</p>

<p>Suddenly an ingenious plan occurred to Graham. It was
to dress himself in the fallen Indian’s dress, walk boldly into
their camp, and be guided by circumstances. After a moment’s
consultation, it was acquiesced in by all. Haldidge
made his way to where the savage lay, and hastily stripping
him, returned with his garments. These Graham donned
in a few moments, and was ready. It was agreed that he
should walk leisurely among them, while Haverland and Haldidge
would follow him, and remain nigh enough to be ready
at a moment’s warning. If discovered, he was to seize Ina
and make off in the woods, while his two friends would rush
forward, free Seth, and make an onslaught upon the others.</p>

<p>The fire was now so low, that Graham had little fear of
exposing himself unless compelled to hold a conversation.
The savages started as he came to view, but fortunately said
nothing, as they supposed it to be their comrade. Graham
walked leisurely to the almost dead fire, and seated himself
by Seth. The savages continued placidly smoking their pipes.</p>

<p>“Ugh!” grunted Graham, peering into Seth’s face. The
latter started slightly, looked up, and understood all in a moment.
Seth pointed to his feet; Graham nodded.</p>

<p>“Say, you, you was clever enough to tie up my feet, and,
now just have the kindness to move ’em a little nearer the
fire. Come, do, and I’ll remember you in my will.”</p>

<p>Graham mumbled something, and, stooping forward as he
moved the feet slightly, dexterously cutting the thong at the
same moment.</p>

<p>“Much obliged,” said Seth; “that’ll dew: needn’t take no
further trouble, you old painted heathen.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span></p>

<p>Graham felt that if he could now put Ina upon her guard,
all would be necessary was&mdash;to act. But this was hardly
possible. While ruminating upon the next step to be taken,
an Indian addressed him in the Indian tongue. Here was a
dilemma, and Graham was already meditating upon making
the onslaught at once, when the ready wit of Seth came to his
aid. Disguising most completely his voice, the eccentric fellow
replied in the Indian tongue. This slight stratagem was
executed so perfectly, that not a savage entertained the slightest
suspicion that another than their dead comrade had spoken
to them. Another question was put, but before Seth could
reply, there came the startling cry of the whipporwil close at
hand. All the savages sprang to their feet, and one held his
tomahawk, ready to brain the captive Ina, in case they could
not retain her. Another leaped toward Seth, but his surprise
was great, when the man in turn sprang nimbly to his feet,
and this surprise became unbounded, when, doubling himself
like a ball, Seth struck him with tremendous force in the
stomach, knocking him instantly senseless. Quick as thought,
Graham felled the savage standing over Ina, and seizing her
in his arms, plunged into the wood, setting up a loud shout at
the same instant. The scene now became desperate. Haldidge
and Haverland, fired almost to madness, rushed forward,
and the former added his own yells to those of the savages.
Ten minutes after, not an Indian was in sight. Finding it impossible
to withstand this terrible onslaught, they fled precipitately,
carrying with them several desperate wounds and
feelings.</p>

<p>No lives were lost on either side, and not a wound worth
mentioning was received by the assailants. The rout was
complete.</p>

<p>But there was still danger, as the routed Indians would
make all haste to the main body, and would in turn pursue
the whites. This Haldidge remarked, as he struck into the
forest, and called upon the others not to lose sight of him.
There was danger of this, indeed.</p>

<p>“By gracious! yew, Haverland, things begin to look up,”
exclaimed Seth.</p>

<p>“Thank God!” responded the father, with a trembling
voice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>

<p>Ina, for a few moments after her recapture, was so bewildered
as not to comprehend the true state of affairs. Finally,
she realized that she was in the arms of friends.</p>

<p>“Am I safe? Where is father?” she asked.</p>

<p>“Here, my dearest child,” answered the parent, pressing
her to his heart.</p>

<p>“Is mother and aunty safe?”</p>

<p>“Yes, all&mdash;all are safe, I trust now.”</p>

<p>“And who are these, with you?”</p>

<p>“This is Haldidge, a dear friend of ours, to whom, under
Heaven, your rescue is owing, and&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Just hold on, Alf, now, if you please; that’s plenty,” interrupted
the hunter.</p>

<p>“Of course I did not mean to leave out Seth here, and&mdash;”</p>

<p>“No, by gracious, it wouldn’t do, especially when you recollect
how nice it was that me and Graham gave ’em the
slip.”</p>

<p>“You, and who?” eagerly asked Ina.</p>

<p>“Me and Mr. Graham&mdash;that fellow standing there&mdash;the one
that has come out here to marry you. Haven’t you heard
of him?”</p>

<p>Ina stepped forward, and scrutinized the face before her.</p>

<p>“Don’t you remember me?” asked Graham, pleasantly.</p>

<p>“Oh, is it you? I am <em>so</em> glad you are here,” she repeated,
placing both her hands in his, and looking up into his face.</p>

<p>“Now just see here,” said Seth, stepping earnestly forward,
“I ’bject to this. Cos why, you haven’t the time to go into
the sparking business, and if you do, why you’ll be obsarved.
I advise you to postpone it till you git home. What’s the
opinion of the audience?”</p>

<p>“Your suggestion is hardly necessary,” laughed Graham.
“The <em>business</em> you referred to, shall most certainly be deferred
until a more convenient season.”</p>

<p>“It gives me great pleasure,” remarked Haverland, “to witness
this reunion of friends, and I thank God that my dear
child, so nearly lost forever, has been restored to me; but,
there is another, whose heart is nearly broken, who should not
be kept waiting, and there is a long distance between us and
perfect safety, which should be shortened as rapidly and
quickly as possible.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>

<p>“That’s the idea,” added Haldidge, “it won’t do to consider
yourself safe till you <em>are</em>, and that isn’t yet.”</p>

<p>“Jest so, exactly, and consequently all fall into line of
march.”</p>

<p>Our friends now set out on a rapid walk homeward. As
had been remarked, there was yet a long distance to be passed,
and even now, while surrounded by darkness, it was reckless
to halt or lag upon the way. Haldidge, as well as Seth,
resolved that they should not pause until it was evident that
Ina needed rest. Both well knew that the Mohawks would
not yield up their captives, as long as there was a chance to
regain them.</p>

<p>Seth’s only fear now was that they would be pursued and
overtaken by some of the savages. That this apprehension
was well grounded, the events which we shall now record,
will plainly show.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XV" id="CHAPTER_XV"></a>CHAPTER XV.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">MANEUVERING AND SCHEMING.</span></h2>


<p>Through the entire night, with now and then an occasional
halt of a few minutes each, the fugitives&mdash;for they may
now properly be termed such&mdash;continued their journey. When
day broke, they halted in a small valley through which a
small, sparkling stream made its way. On either side, it was
surrounded by dark overhanging forest-trees and heavier undergrowth,
through which none but the eagle eye of the hunter or
savage, could discover their retreat.</p>

<p>Seth, when they first halted, made off in the woods, and in
the course of a half-hour returned with a large fowl. The
feathers were plucked from this, a fire kindled, and in a few
moments it was cooked. It furnished all with a hearty, substantial
and nourishing breakfast&mdash;what all needed. After
this, a short consultation was held, when it was determined
that they should halt for an hour or two. Several blankets
were spread upon the green sward, as a bed for Ina, and in
ten minutes she was sound asleep.</p>

<p>Our friends had decided upon making their homeward journey
upon foot for several reasons, any of which was sufficient
to influence them. In the first place, their course would be
much shorter and more direct, and was really attended with
less danger; and even if they desired to take to the river, there
were no means at hand to do it.</p>

<p>“By gracious!” remarked Seth, after a few minute’s deep
thought, “I feel, boys, as though we’re to run into a scrape
before we get home. I tell <em>yeou</em> I do.”</p>

<p>“And I do, too,” added Haldidge. “I don’t know why it is,
and yet I believe there is reason for it. If there is any chance
for them Mohawks to play the game of <em>tit for tat</em>, they’ll do it;
you can make up your mind to that.”</p>

<p>“Do you think the chance is given them?” queried Haverland.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>

<p>“I am afraid we can’t help it, any way we choose to fix it.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean? What do you refer to?”</p>

<p>“You see, them Ingins can’t help knowing the way we’ll
have to take to reach home, and what is to hinder them from
getting ahead of us and giving us a little trouble?”</p>

<p>“Nothing at all, that’s the fact. Our utmost vigilance will
be required at every step. Don’t you think, Seth, that one of
us should act in the capacity of scout?”</p>

<p>“I <em>know</em> it; not only one, but two. As soon as we start, I
shall shoot ahead and pilot you along, while one of you must
flourish in the rear to announce any new visitors. This is the
only way we can ever expect to move along with dignity.”</p>

<p>“What course do you suppose the savages will take?”
asked Graham.</p>

<p>“I guess they ain’t in the neighborhood, though it’s darned
hard to tell where they are. You can make up your mind
that they’ll show themselves before we get any great distance
ahead. They’ll be dodging round in the woods till they find
out where we are, and then they’ll use their wits to draw us
into ambush, and I can tell <em>yeou</em>, too, that cuter ones than we
have walked right into the infarnal things.”</p>

<p>An hour later, when preparations were making for resuming
their journey, Ina awoke. She was greatly refreshed by
the sleep thus obtained, and the others felt cheered and hopeful
at the prospect of a rapid march for the day.</p>

<p>The burden and responsibility of this small band of adventurers
naturally devolved upon Haldidge and Seth. Haverland,
although a thorough hunter and woodsman, had had little
or no experience in Indian warfare, and accordingly showed
himself to be devoid of that suspicious watchfulness which
makes up the success of the frontier ranger. As for Graham,
he was suspicious enough, but he lacked also the great teacher&mdash;experience.
Seth and Haldidge thus thrown together, rapidly
consulted and determined in all cases the precautionary
measures to be adopted. In the present instance, it was decided
that Haldidge should linger some hundred yards in the
rear, and use all the opportunities thus afforded of watching
the actions or approach of their enemies. The same duty was
imposed upon Seth, with the additional certainty upon his
part, that the entire safety of the company rested with him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<p>Haverland and Graham generally walked side by side, with
Ina between them, and as watchful as though they had none
but themselves to depend upon. They seldom indulged in
conversation, except now and then to exchange a few words
or inquiries.</p>

<p>As Seth Jones was well satisfied in his own mind, that the
part of danger was held by him, we will follow his adventures.
After emerging from the valley, in which the whites had encamped,
their way for a considerable distance led through the
unbroken forest, without hill or vale, and pretty thickly
crowded with bushy, yielding undergrowth. Had a person
chanced to cross the path of Seth, the only evidence he would
have had of the presence of a human being, would have been
the snapping of a twig now and then, or the flitting of his form
like a shadow from tree to tree, and perhaps the shrill, bird-like
whistle as he signaled to those in the rear.</p>

<p>Through the forenoon, nothing occurred to excite suspicion
upon his part, but at the period mentioned, he arrived at a
point where his alarm was excited at once. The place offered
such advantages for an Indian ambush, that he gave the signal
for those behind to halt, and determined to make a thorough
reconnoissance of the whole locality before passing
through it. The spot referred to, had the appearance of having
formerly been the bed of some large-sized lake, the water
of which having dried up years before, left a rich, productive
soil which was now covered over with the rankest undergrowth
and vegetation. Not a tree of any size appeared.
The hollow, or valley, was so much depressed that from the
stand-point of Seth, he obtained a perfect view of the whole
portion. It was of about a third of a mile in breadth, and
perhaps a couple of miles in length.</p>

<p>Seth stood a long time, running his eye over it, scanning
every spot where it seemed likely an enemy might lurk.
Hardly a point escaped his keen vision.</p>

<p>It was while he stood thus, eagerly scanning the valley,
that his looks were suddenly attracted toward a point near the
center of the valley, from which a faint, bluish wreath of smoke
was curling upward. This puzzled our friend greatly. He
possessed the curious, investigating habits so generally ascribed
to his race, and his curiosity was wonderfully excited by this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
occurrence. That there was some design in it, not understood
yet, he was well satisfied, and he determined that, before allowing
those behind him to venture into the valley, he would
gain all knowledge possible of it. His first step was to take
his own trail backward until he reached Haverland and Graham,
to whom he imparted his intention. This done, he set
forward again.</p>

<p>Having arrived at the point where he had first discovered
this suspicious appearance, he paused again for further consideration.
The smoke was still visible, rising very slowly in the
clear air, and making so slight an appearance that even his experienced
eye searched a long time for it. Seth watched for
a while, until he felt that he could not understand the meaning
of it without venturing into the valley. This conclusion
arrived at, he hesitated no longer, but descended and entered
at once the luxuriant growth.</p>

<p>When fairly within it, he made a detour to the right, so as
to pass around the fire, and to avoid the path that one unsuspicious
of danger would be apt to follow. As he made his
way slowly and cautiously forward, he paused at intervals and
listened intently. Sometimes he bent his ear to the ground
and lay for minutes at a time. But as yet, not the slightest
sound had been heard. Finally he judged that he must be
near the fire that had excited his apprehensions. The snapping
of a burning ember guided him, and a few minutes later
he stood within sight of it.</p>

<p>Here he met a sight that chilled him with horror!</p>

<p>Some wretched human being was bound to a tree and had
been burned to death. He was painted black as death, his
scalped head drooped forward, so that, from where Seth stood,
it was impossible to distinguish his features; but he saw
enough to make him shudder at the awful fate he had so narrowly
escaped. Every vestige of flesh was burnt off to the
knees, and the bones, white and glistening, dangled to the
crisp and blackened members above! The hands, tied behind,
had passed through the fire unscathed, but every other part of
the body was literally roasted! The smoke in reality was the
smoke from this human body, and the stench which was now
horrible, had been noticed by Seth long before he suspected
the cause.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>

<p>“Heavens and earth!” he muttered to himself, “this is the
first time I ever saw a person burnt at the stake, and I hope
to God it will be the last time. Can he be a <em>white man</em>?”</p>

<p>After some cautious maneuvering, he gained a point from
which he could obtain a view of the face, and he experienced
considerable relief when he discovered that it was not a white
man. He was probably some unfortunate Indian, belonging
to a hostile tribe, who had been captured by his enemies, and
upon whom they had thus wreaked their vengeance. Whether
he was a Mohawk or the member of another tribe, it was impossible
for Seth, under the circumstances, to tell. But what
was singular and unaccountable to Seth, was, that there appeared
to be no other savages in the vicinity. He knew it
was not their custom to leave a prisoner thus, and the very
fact of their being absent upon the present occasion, made him
doubly cautious and suspicious.</p>

<p>It was while he stood meditating upon the terrible scene before
him, that he was startled by the report of Haldidge’s rifle.
He was satisfied that it was his as it was from that direction,
and he could not be mistaken in the report. He had noticed
it during the conflict the night before, as having a peculiar
sound entirely different from either his own or the savages’.
This was a new source of wonder and perplexity. He was
completely puzzled by the extraordinary turn affairs were taking.
Some unusual cause must have discharged Haldidge’s
rifle. What it was he could only conjecture.</p>

<p>Still doubtful and cautious, he determined to reconnoiter his
own position before returning. Stooping almost to the earth,
he made his way stealthily around to the opposite side of the
fire. Here he stretched out flat upon the earth and bent his
ear to the ground. A faint tremor was heard. He raised his
head and heard the brushing of some body through the wood.
The next moment, five Mohawk warriors, in all the horrid
panoply of war paint, stepped into the open space in front of
the Indian who had been burnt at the stake.</p>

<p>The report of the rifle appeared to be the cause of the apprehension
among them. They conversed earnestly in a low
tone at first, gesticulating violently, without noticing in the
least the heart-sickening spectacle before them. Seth was satisfied
that they had no suspicions of his own proximity, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
they gradually spoke louder until he managed to overhear the
most of what they said. As he expected, it was the rifle report.
They seemed to understand that it had not been discharged
by one of their own number, and were afraid that
their presence had been discovered. Seth learned further that
there were at least a dozen Indians in the neighborhood, every
one of whom were led thither by the one object.</p>

<p>Consequently he must have missed the others entirely in his
movements, or else they were in the rear and had been discovered
by Haldidge. That the latter was the case, seemed
more than probable. A collision in all probability had occurred
between them and the hunter, and Seth felt that his presence
was needed. Accordingly he turned to retrace his steps.</p>

<p>His presence was indeed required, for danger, dark and
threatening, surrounded the little band of whites.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVI" id="CHAPTER_XVI"></a>CHAPTER XVI.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">IN WHICH A HUNTER’S NERVES ARE TESTED.</span></h2>


<p>In the morning when our friends started upon their day’s
march, Haldidge, as said, fell behind in order to guard against
surprise from this direction. Although expecting as little as
did Seth any demonstration from this quarter, still he was too
much of a backwoodsman to allow himself to lose any of his
usual suspicion and watchfulness. Sometimes he would take
his back trail for a long distance, and then wander off to the
right or left of it for perhaps a mile or more. By this means,
he kept a continual watch not only upon the trail itself but
upon the neighborhood for a long distance around it, and, in
case of pursuit, made so many and conflicting tracks, that it
could not but puzzle and delay their enemies.</p>

<p>Near noon, and at the very moment that Seth paused to
take a survey of the suspicious valley-like depression, and
when not more than a furlong in the rear, Haldidge caught
sight of three Indians just ahead of him. They were sitting
upon the ground, in perfect silence, and seemingly waiting for
the approach of some one. The hunter found himself as much
perplexed, as was Seth to account for what he saw. Whether
it was some stratagem to entrap himself or not he could not
tell, but before venturing farther, he made up his mind to
gain a further knowledge of their intentions.</p>

<p>Haldidge had one formidable difficulty to contend with: the
wood at this particular spot was open, and almost devoid of
the protecting undergrowth, so that it was about impossible to
approach them closer without discovering himself to them.
He noticed lying a short distance behind them a large, heavy
log, apparently much decayed. In fact this was so near them,
that could he gain it, he could overhear every thing said. He
had a slight knowledge of the Mohawk tongue&mdash;not enough to
converse in it&mdash;but still enough to understand the drift of a conversation.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
Accordingly he determined to reach the spot at all
hazards.</p>

<p>Haldidge desired, if possible, to communicate with Haverland
and warn him of the proximity of danger. To do this,
it was necessary to make a long <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">detour</i>, and upon further consideration
he decided not to attempt it. Lying flat upon his
face, he worked himself toward the log mentioned, keeping it
between himself and the Indians, and approaching as silently
and steadily as a snake. So cautiously and carefully was it
done, that it required at least twenty minutes to reach it, and
all this time, the Indians maintained the same unbroken silence.
At length, the concealment was reached, and the hunter noticed
with pleasure that it was hollow. He lost no time in
entering it, where, coiling himself up in as small a space as
possible, he took himself to listening. As if to completely favor
him, there was a small rent in the log, through which even
the whisper of the savages could be heard, and which also
admitted a thin ray of light.</p>

<p>Here Haldidge cramped himself up and listened intently.
But not a word was exchanged between the Indians, who remained
as motionless as statues. In the course of a few
minutes he heard a footfall upon the leaves, and a second after
several savages seated themselves upon the very log in which
he had concealed himself! He judged that there were at least
a half dozen. Those whom he had first seen appeared to have
risen, and, meeting the others, they had all seated themselves
upon the log together.</p>

<p>They immediately commenced conversing in so low and
guttural tones, that their deep base voices communicated their
tremor to the log. Haldidge started as he soon learned that
they were conversing about himself and the three fugitives.
Of Seth they seemed to have no knowledge. He discovered
that they had lain in ambush a short distance ahead to entrap
Haverland, Graham, and Ina, and they were debating how <em>he</em>
should be disposed of. They knew that he was acting in the
capacity of scout and sentinel, and were fearful that he might
detect the ambush, or at least escape it himself.</p>

<p>At this point, one of the Indians, probably impelled by some
whim, stooped and looked into the log. Haldidge knew from
the darkness thus occasioned, that one of them was peering in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
it, and he scarcely breathed for a few seconds. But the face
was removed, and the hollow being dark within&mdash;the small
rent being upon the opposite side of the hunter&mdash;the savage
felt reassured and resumed the conversation.</p>

<p>But Haldidge was doomed to have a trial of his nerves, of
which he little dreamed. When he entered the log, it was
head foremost, so that his feet were toward the opening, and
his face was in the dim light beyond. He judged the rotten
cavity extended several feet further back; but, as there was
no necessity for entering farther, he did not attempt to explore
it. It was while he lay thus, his whole soul bent to the one
act of listening, that he was startled by the deadly warning of
a rattlesnake! He comprehended the truth in an instant.
<em>There was one of these reptiles in the log beyond him!</em></p>

<p>It is difficult to imagine a more fearful situation than the
hunter’s at this moment. He was literally environed by death;
for it was at his head, his feet, and above him, and there was
no escape below. He had just learned that his death was one
of the objects of the Indians, so that to back out into their
clutches would be nothing less than committing suicide. To
remain where he was, would be to disregard the second and
last warning of the coiled rattlesnake. What was to be done?
Manifestly nothing but to die like a man. Haldidge decided
to risk the bite of the rattlesnake!</p>

<p>Despite himself, the hunter felt that the reptile was exerting
its horrible fascination over him. Its small eyes, gleaming
like tiny, yet fiery stars, seemed to emit a magnetic ray&mdash;thin,
pointed and palpable, that pierced right into his brain. There
was a malignant subtlety&mdash;an irresistible magnetism. Now
the small, glittering point of light seemed to recede, then to
approach and expand, and then to wave and undulate all
around him. Sometimes that bright, lightning-like ray would
shiver and tremble, and then straighten out with metal-like
rigidity, and insinuate itself into his very being like the invisible
point of a spear.</p>

<p>There was a desire on the part of Haldidge to shake off this
influence, which wrapped him like a mantle. There was the
desire, we say, and yet there was a languid listlessness&mdash;a repugnance
to making the effort. The feeling was something similar
to that produced by a powerful opiate, when we are first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
recovering from it. There was that dim consciousness&mdash;that
indistinct knowledge of the outer world&mdash;that certainty, that
we can break the bond that holds us, by one vigorous effort,
and yet the same sluggish indifference that prevents the attempt.</p>

<p>Haldidge drew his breath faintly and slowly, yielding more
and more to that fatal subtle influence. He knew he was
charmed, and yet he couldn’t help it. It was now impossible
to shake off that weight which pressed him down like an incubus.
That outer world&mdash;so to speak&mdash;had now receded, and
he was in another, from which he could not return without
help beside his own. He seemed to be moving, flitting, sinking,
and rising, through the thin air, borne upward and downward,
hither and thither, on a wing of fire. The spell was
complete. That extraordinary power which instinct holds
over reason&mdash;that wonderful superiority which a reptile sometimes
shows he can exert over man, the snake now held over
the hunter.</p>

<p>At this point, from some cause or other, one of the savages
struck the log a violent blow with his hatchet. Haldidge
heard it. He drew a long breath, closed his eyes, and when
he reopened them, looked down at his hands upon which his
chin had been resting.</p>

<p>The charm was broken! the hunter had shaken off the fatal
spell!</p>

<p>Like the knocking at the gate in Macbeth, which dispels
the dark, awful world of gloom in which the murderers have
been moving and living, and ushers in our own world, with
all its hurrying tide of human life and passions; so this blow
of the Indian’s tomahawk broke the subtle, magnetic spell of
the serpent, and lifted the heavy mantle-like influence which
wrapped Haldidge in its folds.</p>

<p>He looked downward, and determined not to raise his eyes
again, for he knew the same power would again rise above
him. The serpent, seemingly conscious of its loss of influence,
rattled once more, and prepared to strike. Haldidge stirred
not a muscle; in fact, he had scarcely moved since entering
the log. But the snake did not strike. The continued, death-like
stillness of the hunter, evidently seemed to the reptile to
be death itself. He coiled and uncoiled himself several times,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
and then lifting his head, crawled directly over his neck and
body, and passed out of the log! Here he was killed by the
Indians.</p>

<p>Now that the hunter was himself again, he prepared for further
action. The Indians had arisen from the log and were at
some distance. He could hear the mumbling of their voices,
but could not distinguish their words. After awhile these
ceased, and he heard no more.</p>

<p>Haldidge was now filled with apprehension for the others.
He had enough faith in the power and cunning of Seth to feel
pretty confident that he would neither lead any one into ambush
or fall into one himself, let it be prepared as skillfully as
it might be; but then he could know nothing of the Indians in
the rear, who might surprise Haverland and Graham at any
moment.</p>

<p>The hunter at length grew so restless and uneasy that he
emerged from his hiding-place as rapidly and silently as possible.
He looked cautiously around, but no savage was in sight.
Filled with the most painful apprehensions, he hastened through
the wood, avoiding the trail of his friends, however, and finally
came in sight of them. Before making himself known he concluded
to reconnoiter the place. While doing so, he saw the
head of an Indian rise slowly above a bush, and peer over at
the unconscious whites. Without losing a moment, he raised
his rifle, took a quick but sure aim, and fired. Then calling
out to Haverland and Graham, he sprang for an instant into
view.</p>

<p>“Make for cover!” he shouted; “the Indians are upon us!”</p>

<p>In an instant, every one of the whites was invisible.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVII" id="CHAPTER_XVII"></a>CHAPTER XVII.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">ENCOMPASSED BY DANGER.</span></h2>


<p>At the first warning of Haldidge, Haverland comprehended
the threatened danger in an instant. Catching Ina in his
arms, he sprang into the wood, sheltering himself behind a
tree so quickly that Ina, till that moment, did not comprehend
the meaning of the startling movements around her.</p>

<p>“What is it, father?” she whispered.</p>

<p>“Keep quiet, daughter, and don’t move.”</p>

<p>She said no more but shrank beneath his sheltering form,
believing that his strong arm was capable of protecting her
against any foe, however formidable.</p>

<p>Graham, at the alarm, had leaped toward Haldidge, and the
two sheltered themselves within a few feet of each other. The
shot of the hunter had been fatal, for that yell, which the
North American Indian, like the animal, gives when he receives
his death-wound, was heard, and the fall had also
reached his ears.</p>

<p>Minute after minute passed away and nothing further was
heard of the savages. This silence was as full of meaning,
and as dangerous as any open demonstration upon the part of
the Indian. What new plan they might be concocting was a
mystery to all but themselves. At length Graham ventured to
speak:</p>

<p>“What do you suppose they’re up to, Haldidge?”</p>

<p>“Hatching some devilish plot, I expect.”</p>

<p>“It seems it requires a good while to do it.”</p>

<p>“Don’t get impatient; they’ll show themselves in time.”</p>

<p>“Have you any idea of their number?”</p>

<p>“There were something like a half-dozen prowling around.”</p>

<p>“There is one less now at any rate.”</p>

<p>“I suppose so; but there’s enough left to occasion a little
trouble at least. Where did Alf go with the gal?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<p>“Off yonder, a short distance. Hadn’t we better get closer
together?”</p>

<p>“No; I don’t know as there is any necessity for it. We’re
as safe, drawn up in this style, as in any other I can imagine.”</p>

<p>“I am afraid, Haldidge, they will make an attempt to surround
us. In such a case, wouldn’t Haverland be in great
peril?”</p>

<p>“They can’t get around him without running their heads in
range with our rifles, and Alf is a man who’ll be pretty sure to
discover such a trick without any help.”</p>

<p>“Where can Seth be?”</p>

<p>“Not very far off; that shot of mine will be pretty sure to
bring him.”</p>

<p>“Haldidge, how was it that you discovered these Mohawks?
Did you know of their presence before you fired?”</p>

<p>“Yes, long before. I’ve an idea they’ve been tracking you
for an hour or two.”</p>

<p>“Why, then, was their attack deferred?”</p>

<p>“They have made no attack, remember. I don’t believe they
had any such intention. There is an ambush somewhere
ahead that they have laid, and it was their idea to walk you
into that.”</p>

<p>“What was their notion in watching us so closely.”</p>

<p>“They were hunting for me, for I heard them say as much,
and, I suppose, in case you didn’t walk into their trap, why
they were going to make the attack.”</p>

<p>“Can it be that Seth has fallen into the snare?” asked Graham
in anxious tones.</p>

<p>“No, sir; such a thing can’t be. He isn’t such a fool as
that amounts to. He is making himself generally useful; you
can make your mind to that. He is a smart chap, for all he
is the most awkward, long-legged, gawky person I ever came
across.”</p>

<p>“I am puzzled to know who he is. It seems to me that
he is only playing a part. Several times in conversing with
him, he has used language such as none but a scholar and polished
gentleman would use. At others and most of the time,
he uses that ungainly mode of expression, which in itself, is
laughable. At any rate, whoever he may be, he is a friend,
and the interest which he takes in the safety of Haverland and
his family is as efficient as it is singular.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>

<p>“Maybe the interest is in Ina,” said Haldidge with a sly
look.</p>

<p>“I understand you, but you are mistaken. He has assured
me as much. No; there seems nothing of that feeling at all
in him. He loves her as he would a child, but no more.”</p>

<p>“How was it that he made that awkward tumble into the
Indians hands, when they gave you such a hard run for it?”</p>

<p>“That was all through my own blundering. He was cautious
enough, but I became so impatient and careless that I
precipitated him into the danger which would have been fatal to
any one else. It was no fault of his.”</p>

<p>“I am glad to hear it, for it seemed odd to me.”</p>

<p>This conversation which we have recorded, it must not be
supposed, was not carried on in an ordinary tone, and with
that earnestness which would have lessened their habitual caution.
It was in whispers, and hardly once during its progress
did the two look at each other. Sometimes they would not
speak for several minutes, and then exchange but a single
question and answer.</p>

<p>It was now toward the middle of the afternoon, and it became
pretty evident that the night would have to be spent in
this neighborhood.</p>

<p>“I do hope that Seth will make his appearance before dark,”
remarked Graham.</p>

<p>“Yes; I hope he will, for it will be dangerous when we
can’t see him.”</p>

<p>“He must be aware of the threatened danger.”</p>

<p>“Yes; I am pretty confident that he is not very distant.”</p>

<p>“Hallo! what’s that?” whispered Graham.</p>

<p>“Ah! keep quiet; there’s something going on there.”</p>

<p>A death-like silence reigned for a few minutes; then, a
slight rustling was heard close by Haldidge, and as he turned
his alarmed gaze toward it, the form of Seth Jones rose to his
feet beside him.</p>

<p>“Where did you come from?” asked Graham in astonishment.</p>

<p>“I have been watching you. In a little trouble, eh?”</p>

<p>“We’ve found out we’ve got neighbors.”</p>

<p>“They’re not very nigh neighbors leastways.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?”</p>

<p>“There isn’t one in a quarter of a mile.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>

<p>Haldidge and Graham looked at the speaker in astonishment.</p>

<p>“I tell <em>you</em>, it’s so. Hallo, Haverland!” he called, stepping
out from his concealment. “Come out here; there is nothing
to be afraid of.”</p>

<p>The manner of the speaker was singular, but the others well
knew that he was not one to expose either himself or others
to danger, and accordingly all gathered around him.</p>

<p>“Are you not running great risk?” asked Haverland, still experiencing
some slight misgivings at stepping upon a spot
which he well knew was so dangerous a short time before.</p>

<p>“No, sir; I reckon you needn’t be at all skeerish, for if
there was any danger of them Mohawks, I wouldn’t be standing
here.”</p>

<p>“It’s getting toward night, Seth, and we should make up
our minds at once as to what we are going to do or how we
are going to spend it.”</p>

<p>“Can you shoot a gun?” asked Seth suddenly, of Ina.</p>

<p>“I don’t believe you can beat me,” she answered lightly.</p>

<p>“That is good.”</p>

<p>So saying, he stepped into the bushes, where the dead body
of the Indian was lying. Stooping over him, he removed the
rifle from his rigid grasp, took his bullet-pouch and powder,
and handed them to Ina.</p>

<p>“Now, there are five of us, all well armed,” said he, “and
if any of them infarnal Mohawks gets ahead of us, we all desarve
red night-caps for it.”</p>

<p>“How are we to prevent it, when there seems to be ten
times our number following us?” asked Haverland.</p>

<p>“The way on it is this ere: there is about a dozen trying
to sarcumvent us. They’re now ahead of us, and have laid an
ambush for us. If we can pass that ambush we’re safe as if
we was home fair and sure. And there must be no <em>if</em> about
it, for that ambush must be passed to-night.”</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVIII" id="CHAPTER_XVIII"></a>CHAPTER XVIII.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">GETTING OUT OF THE WILDERNESS.</span></h2>


<p>Night, dark and gloomy, slowly settled over the forest.
Nothing was heard save the dull soughing of the wind through
the tree-tops, or the occasional howl of the wolf in the distance,
or perhaps the near scream of the panther. Heavy,
tumultuous clouds were wheeling through the sky, rendering
the inky darkness doubly intense, and shrouding even the
clearings in impenetrable gloom.</p>

<p>By and by, the distant rumble of thunder came faintly
through the air, and then a quivering fork of fire, like a
stream of blood, trembled upon the edge of the dark storm-cloud
for an instant. The heavy clouds, growing darker and
more awful, poured forward until they seemed to concentrate
in the western sky, where they towered aloft like some old
embattled castle. The thunder grew heavier, until it sounded
like the rolling of chariot wheels over the courts of heaven,
and the red streams of liquid fire streamed down the dark walls
of the Storm Castle. Now and then the subtle element flamed
out into a dazzling, instantaneous flash, and the bolt burst
overhead.</p>

<p>“Keep close to me and step light, for I tell <em>you</em> there’s
enough lightning.”</p>

<p>Seth had thoroughly reconnoitered the valley to which we
have referred, and had found, as he expected, that there was
an ambush laid for them. There was a sort of foot-path,
apparently worn by the passing of wild animals, which nearly
crossed the valley. It was here that the Indians supposed
the fugitives would be entrapped, until the death of a too
daring member of their party led them to suspect that their
intentions were discovered.</p>

<p>The little band was hours in crossing this valley. Seth, with
an almost inaudible “sh!” would often pause, and they would
stand for many anxious minutes listening intently for the dreaded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
danger. Then they would resume their march, stepping
with painful slowness.</p>

<p>It was at least three hours after the fugitives commenced
this journey, and when Seth judged that he must be nearly
through it, that he suddenly discovered he was walking in the
very path he had striven so carefully to avoid. He was considerably
startled at this, and left at once.</p>

<p>“Sh! down!” he whispered, turning his face behind him.</p>

<p>They were not ten feet from the path, when they all sank
quietly to the earth. Footsteps were now audible to all. The
darkness was too profound to discern any thing, but all
heard their enemies almost near enough to touch them with
the outstretched hand.</p>

<p>The situation of our friends was imminently perilous. The
Mohawks were not passing along the path, as at first supposed,
but evidently searching it! Haldidge and Seth felt that
they could not be aware of their proximity, and yet they knew
a discovery was unavoidable.</p>

<p>Seth Jones rose to his feet so silently, that even Haldidge,
who was within a foot of him, did not hear a rustle. He
then touched Haverland’s ear with his mouth, and whispered:</p>

<p>“Scatter with the gal as quick as lightning, for they must
find us out in a minute.”</p>

<p>Haverland lifted Ina in his strong arm&mdash;she needed no caution,
and stepped forward. It was impossible not to make
some noise, when the wet bushes brushed against them. The
savages heard it and started cautiously forward. They evidently
suspected it was the fugitives, and had no suspicion
that any one was lingering in the rear. The first warning
Seth had, was of a savage running plump against him.</p>

<p>“Beg your pardon, I didn’t see you,” exclaimed Seth, as
each bounded backward. “Curse you,” he muttered, “I only
wish I could sight you for a minute.”</p>

<p>Seth, Haldidge and Graham were now maneuvering against
some five or six Indians. Had a bright flash of lightning illuminated
the scene, just at this time, it is probable that all
would have laughed outright, at the attitude and movements
of themselves. The Indians, upon finding how near they
were to their deadliest enemies, immediately bounded backward
several yards, in order to avoid a too sudden collision<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
with them. The three whites did precisely the same thing&mdash;each
in his own characteristic way. Seth leaped to one side,
crouched down in his usual panther-like manner, and with his
rifle in his left, and his knife in his right hand, waited until
he could settle in his mind the precise spot upon which one
of the savages was standing, before making a lunge at him.</p>

<p>It would be tedious to narrate the artifices and stratagem
resorted to by these two opposing forces. Simon Kenton and
Daniel Boone, once reached the opposite aides of the Ohio
river at the same moment, and at the same time, each became
aware of the presence of another person upon the other side.
These two old hunters and acquaintances reconnoitered for
over <em>twenty-four hours</em>, before they discovered that they were
friends. For nearly two hours, the Mohawks and the whites
maneuvered with the most consummate skill against each
other. Now retreating and leading, dodging and eluding,
each striving to lead the other into some trap that was as
skillfully avoided, until, judging that Haverland was safe, Seth
concluded to retreat himself accordingly, he cautiously withdrew,
and ten minutes later, found himself upon the outermost
edge of the valley.</p>

<p>Ten minutes after Seth departed, Haldidge moved off, of
course unknown to himself, in precisely the same direction.
Graham soon adopted the same course. They all came out
of the dangerous valley within twenty feet of each other. It
took them some time before they came together; but, as each
suspected the identity of the other, this did not require as long
as it otherwise would.</p>

<p>“Now, boys,” whispered Seth, “I cac’late we’re out of the
Valley of Death. Best give it a wide berth, is the private
opinion of Seth Jones.”</p>

<p>“But how about Haverland?” asked Graham.</p>

<p>“I think they must have come out near that point,” replied
the other.</p>

<p>“Let us move round then, and we’ve got to be spry, for
daylight can’t be far off, and I’m thinking as how them Ingins
will find out that we’ve absconded; and my gracious! won’t
they feel cheap?”</p>

<p>Just as the light of morning appeared in the east, they
came upon Haverland, and resumed their journey. No halt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
was made for breakfast, for they were all too anxious to get
forward upon their way. In the course of an hour or so,
they struck a sort of path, made by the passage of wild animals,
which, besides being so hardened as to conceal their
trail, was easily traveled.</p>

<p>Seth and Haldidge were too experienced woodsmen to relax
their vigilance. They maintained the same duties as before,
the former taking it upon himself to lead the way through the
wilderness, and the latter to guard against danger from behind.
The settlement toward which they were so anxiously hastening,
was still several days distant, and to reach it, it was necessary
to cross a river of considerable breadth. This river was
reached by Seth at noon.</p>

<p>“By gracious! I forgot about this!” he exclaimed to himself.
“Wonder if the gal can swim? If she can’t, how are
we going to get her over? Put her on a chip, I s’pose, and
let the breeze blow her across: the rest of us can swim, in
course.”</p>

<p>A few minutes later, our friends stood consulting upon the
bank of the stream.</p>

<p>This consultation ended in active preparations for crossing
on a raft. Hunting up material for constructing a raft now
was the order of the hour. This was work of extreme difficulty.
They had no instruments except their hunting-knives,
and these were little better than nothing. Large, rotten limbs
were broken from the trees, and placed together by Haverland,
who took upon himself the task of lashing them with withes,
while the others collected wood.</p>

<p>Haldidge went up the river, and Seth and Graham went
down. Graham soon noticed a large, half-decayed log, lying
partly in the water. “Just the thing, exactly! Why it’s a
raft itself. This will save further trouble. Let us launch it
at once, and float it up to the spot,” he said, delightedly.</p>

<p>The two approached it, stooped, and were in the very act
of lifting it into the water, when Seth suddenly removed his
shoulder, and arose to the upright position.</p>

<p>“Come, give a lift,” said Graham.</p>

<p>“Graham, I guess I wouldn’t take the log, I don’t think it
will answer.”</p>

<p>“Won’t answer? Why not? In the name of common
sense, give some reason.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>

<p>“<em>Let that log alone! Do you understand?</em>”</p>

<p>Graham looked up, and started at the appearance of Seth.
His eyes fairly scintillated and he seemed ready to spring upon
him, for daring to utter a word of dispute.</p>

<p>“Come along with me!” commanded Seth, in a voice hoarse
with passion.</p>

<p>It wouldn’t do to disregard that command; and, taking up
his rifle, Graham lost no time in obeying it. But he wondered
greatly whether Seth was suddenly become crazy or
foolish. He followed him a short distance, and then hastened
up beside him. Seeing that his face had recovered its usual
expression, he gained courage and asked what he meant by
such commands?</p>

<p>“Didn’t you take notice that that log was holler?”</p>

<p>“I believe it was, although I did not examine it closely.”</p>

<p>“Wal, if you <em>had</em> examined it closely or even loosely, so
that you took a peep into the log, you’d have seen a big Mohawk
curled up there snug and nice!”</p>

<p>“Is it possible! How came you to see him?”</p>

<p>“The minute I seed the log was holler, I had my s’picions
that there might be something or other in it, and I made up
my mind that we shouldn’t undertake to lift it till I knowd
how it was. When I come to look closer, I knowed thar was
something sure enough, for the way the bark was scratched at
the mouth showed that plain enough. It wouldn’t do, you
see, to stoop down and peep in, for like as not the redskin
would blaze away smack into my face. So I jest dropped my
cap, and, as I stooped down to pick it up, I kind of slewed one
eye ’round over my shoulder, and, as sure as blazes, I seen a
big moccasin! I did, by gracious! I then proceeded to argufy
the question; and, after considerable discussion, both in
the affirmative and negative, I came unanimously to the conclusion
that as I’d seen an Injin’s foot, if I’d foller it up, I’d be
pretty sure to find the Injin himself; and, moreover, also, if
there was <em>one</em> Injin about, you could make up your mind that
there are plenty more not far off. By gracious! If I hadn’t
looked a little ramparageous, you wouldn’t have let go that log
so very quick, eh?”</p>

<p>“No; you alarmed me considerably. But what is to be
done?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span></p>

<p>“The cowards are poking around the woods, fixing out
some plan to ambush us again. They’ve no idea we’ve smelt
the rat that’s brewing in the bud, and they’re too cowardly to
show their faces until they find they’ve got to, or let us slip.”</p>

<p>“Shall we tell Haverland?”</p>

<p>“No; I will let Haldidge know it, if he hasn’t found it out
already. The raft has got to be made, and we must keep on
at it till it’s finished, as though we knowed every thing was
right. Keep still now, or Alf will notice our talking.”</p>

<p>They were so close to the woodman that they changed
their conversation.</p>

<p>“No material?” asked Haverland, looking up.</p>

<p>“It’s rather scarce down where we’ve been,” replied Graham.</p>

<p>“Shan’t I help you?” asked Ina, looking up archly.</p>

<p>“I guess we won’t need your help as Haldidge seems to
have enough already.”</p>

<p>The hunter at this moment approached, bending under the
weight of two heavy limbs. These were instantly lashed together,
but it was found that the raft was much too weak and
light, and more stuff was necessary before it would even float
Ina. Accordingly, Haldidge plunged into the wood again.
Seth walked beside him until they were a few yards away,
when he asked:</p>

<p>“Do you understand?”</p>

<p>“What?” asked the hunter in astonishment.</p>

<p>“Over there,” answered Seth, jerking his thumb over his
shoulder toward the log mentioned.</p>

<p>“Redskins?”</p>

<p>“I rather guess so.”</p>

<p>“I smelt them, awhile ago. You’d better go back and
watch Alf. I’ll get enough wood. Danger!”</p>

<p>“No; they’ll try some game; look out for yourself.”</p>

<p>With this, Seth turned on his heel and rejoined Haverland.
Graham was a short distance away cutting withes, which the
woodman was as busily using. As Seth came up he noticed
Ina. She was sitting upon the ground a few feet from her
father, and her attention seemed wholly absorbed with some
thing down the stream. Seth watched her closely.</p>

<p>“Isn’t that a log yonder?” she asked.</p>

<p>Seth looked in the direction indicated. With no small degree<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
of astonishment, he saw the identical tree which he and
Graham disputed over, afloat in the river. This awoke his apprehensions
and he signaled at once for Haldidge.</p>

<p>“What’s the row?” asked the hunter as he came up.</p>

<p>Seth gave his head a toss down stream, by way of reply,
and added, “Don’t let ’em see you’re watching it, for it might
scare ’em.”</p>

<p>Nevertheless Haldidge turned square around and took a
long, searching look at the suspicious object.</p>

<p>“What do you make of it?”</p>

<p>“Them Mohawks are the biggest fools I ever heard of, to
think that such an old trick as <em>that</em> can amount to any
thing.”</p>

<p>“What trick do you mean?” asked Haverland.</p>

<p>“Why, you see that log yonder, half sunk in the water, that
we are all looking at? Well, there are four or five Mohawks
behind that, waiting for us to launch our raft.”</p>

<p>“Maybe it’s nothing more than a floating tree or log,” said
the woodman.</p>

<p>“Y-e-s,” drawled the hunter sarcastically, “<em>maybe</em> so; I
s’pose a log would be very apt to float <em>up</em> stream, wouldn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Why, is it approaching?” asked Graham.</p>

<p>“Not <em>very</em> fast,” answered Seth, “for I guess it’s hard work
for them fellers to swim up stream. Ah! by gracious! I understand
the game. Look; don’t you see it’s farther out than
it was? They’re going to get as near the middle as they can,
and so close to us that when we undertake to cross, the current
will carry us right down plump against ’em, when they’ll
rise up in their wrath and devour us. Fact, as sure as you
live.”</p>

<p>“We might as well understand matters at once,” added Haldidge.
“The plan of the Indians is undoubtedly the same as
Seth suggests. In crossing, we cannot help drifting downward,
and they are trying to locate themselves so as to make a
collision between us. But they will make no attack until we
are in the water. So you may keep at work upon the raft,
Alf, without any fear, while Seth and I reconnoiter. Come,
Graham, you may as well go along with us. Let us enter the
wood separately at first, and we’ll come together as soon as we
can get out of sight. Act as though we didn’t suspicion any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
thing, and I’ll wager my rifle here against your hat that we’ll
outwit the cowards after all.”</p>

<p>The three entered the wood as proposed. After going a
few yards they came together again.</p>

<p>“Now,” whispered Seth, “by gracious! you will see fun.
Follow close, boys, and keep shady.”</p>

<p>Being now fairly within the wood, they proceeded in a direction
parallel with the course of the river, using extreme caution,
for it was more than probable some of the Indian scouts
were secreted in the wood. Keeping entirely away from the
river until Seth judged they were below the suspicious log, they
approached it. A reckless move, at this point, would have
been fatal. Fortunately, there was a species of grass growing
from the wood out to a considerable distance in the water.
Through this, they made their way much after the fashion of
snakes. Seth, as usual, was in front, and it struck Graham
that he absolutely slid over the ground without any exertion on
his part.</p>

<p>In a moment, they were down to the river’s brink. They
now slowly raised their heads and peered over and through
the grass out into the river. The log was a short distance
above, and they had a perfect view of the side which was opposite
to Haverland. Not a sign of an Indian was visible.
The tree seemed as if anchored in the middle of the stream.</p>

<p>“There is something there!” whispered Graham.</p>

<p>“&mdash;sh! keep quiet and watch and you’ll see!” admonished
Seth.</p>

<p>A moment more, and the log apparently, without any human
agency, slightly changed its position. As it did so, Graham
saw something glisten on the top of it. He was at a loss to
understand what it meant, and turned inquiringly toward Haldidge.
The latter had his keen eye fixed upon it, and there
was a grim, exulting smile upon his face. He motioned for
Graham to preserve silence.</p>

<p>As our hero turned his gaze once more toward the river, he
saw that the log was still further into the stream. Something
like polished metal was seen glistening even brighter than before.
He looked carefully, and in a moment saw that there
were several rifles resting upon the surface of it.</p>

<p>While gazing and wondering where the owners of these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
weapons could conceal themselves, the water suddenly seemed
to part on the side of the log toward them, and the bronzed
face of an Indian rose to view. Up, up, it went, until the
shoulders were out of the water, when he remained stationary
a moment, and peered over the log at Haverland. Seemingly
satisfied, he quietly sank down into the water again; but Graham
noticed that he did not disappear beneath the surface,
where it appeared he had hitherto kept himself, nestled in so
close to the log that almost any one would have supposed he
was a part of it. His head resembled exactly a large black
knot in the wood. Graham now noticed also that there were
two other protuberances, precisely similar to the first. The
conclusion was certain. There were three fully armed Mohawks
concealed behind the log, who were doing their utmost
to steal unawares upon the fugitives.</p>

<p>“Just exactly one apiece, as sure as you live,” exclaimed
Seth exultingly. “Get ready each of you for your man. Graham,
take the one nearest this way; you the next one, Haldidge,
and I’ll pick off the last one in the genuine style. Get
ready quick, for I’ve got to hurrah over the way things is
coming round.”</p>

<p>The three pointed their deathly instruments toward the unsuspicious
savages. Each took a long, deliberate, and certain
aim.</p>

<p>“Now, then, together&mdash;<em>fire</em>!”</p>

<p>Simultaneously the three rifles flashed, but that of Seth
missed fire. The others sped true to their aim. Two yells of
deathly agony broke upon the air, and one of the savages
sprang half his entire length out of the water, and then sank
like lead to the bottom. The other clung quivering to the log
for a moment, and then loosening his hold, disappeared beneath
the water.</p>

<p>“Thunder and blazes!” exclaimed Seth, springing to his
feet, “hand me your rifle, Graham. Something is the matter
with mine, and that other imp will get away. Quick! hand
it here!”</p>

<p>He took the rifle and commenced loading it as rapidly as
possible, keeping his eye upon the Indian who now was swimming
desperately for the other bank.</p>

<p>“Is yer iron loaded, Haldidge?” he asked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span></p>

<p>“No; I’ve been watching you and that chap’s doubling, to
see who’ll get the best, so long, that I didn’t think of it.”</p>

<p>“Load again, for s’posen this gun should miss fire too, he’d
get off then sure. Wal, my stars! if he isn’t coming out
now.”</p>

<p>The Indian, as if scorning the danger, rose slowly from the
water, and walked leisurely toward the shelter of the wood.</p>

<p>“Now, my fine feller, see if you can dodge this.”</p>

<p>Seth once more aimed at the retreating Indian, and this time
pulled the trigger; but to his unutterable chagrin, the rifle
flashed in the pan! Before Haldidge could finish loading
his gun, and before Seth could even reprime his, the Indian
had disappeared in the wood.</p>

<p>“By the hokey-pokey! what’s got into the guns?” exclaimed
Seth in a perfect fury. “That’s <em>twice</em> I’ve been fooled!
Worse’n two slaps in the face by a purty woman, I’ll swow.
Hallo! what’s that?”</p>

<p>The discharge of a rifle across the river had sent the bullet
so close to him as to whisk off a tuft of his long sandy hair!</p>

<p>“By gracious! that was pretty well done,” he exclaimed,
scratching his head as though he was slightly wounded.</p>

<p>“Look out, for heaven’s sake! Get down!” called Graham,
seizing him by the skirt of his hunting dress, and jerking him
downward.</p>

<p>“Don’t know but what it <em>is</em> the best plan,” replied the imperturbable
Seth, going down on his knees in time to avoid
another foul shot. “There are plenty of the imps about, ain’t
there?”</p>

<p>The firing so alarmed Haverland that he desisted from his
work, and sought the shelter of the wood. By this time, too, the
afternoon was so far advanced that darkness had already commenced
settling over the stream and wood. Crossing on the
raft was now out of the question, for it would have been nothing
less than suicide to have attempted it, when their enemies
had given them such convincing evidence of their skill in the
use of the rifle, even at a greater distance than to the middle
of the stream. But the river had to be crossed for all that
and the only course left, was to shift their position to some
other place, build a new raft, and make another place.</p>

<p>There was no excuse for further delay, and the party immediately<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
set forward. The sky again gave signs of a storm.
Several rumbles of thunder were heard, but the lightning was
so distant as to be of neither benefit or use to them. The sky
was filled with heavy, tumultuous clouds, which rendered the
darkness perfectly intense and impenetrable; and, as none of
them understood a foot of the ground over which they were
traveling, it may well be supposed that their progress was neither
rapid nor particularly pleasant. The booming of the
thunder continued, and shortly the rain commenced falling.
The drops were of that big kind which are often formed in
summer, and which rattle through the leaves like a shower of
bullets.</p>

<p>“Can you look ahead, Seth?” asked Graham.</p>

<p>“In course I can. The darkness don’t make no difference
not at all to me. I can see just as well on a dark night as I
can in daylight, and, what is more, <em>I do</em>. I should like to see
me make a misstep or stumble&mdash;”</p>

<p>Further utterance was checked by the speaker pitching,
with a loud splash, head foremost over or into something.</p>

<p>“<em>You</em> hurt, Seth?” asked Graham in alarm, yet half tempted
to give way to the mirth that was convulsing those behind
him.</p>

<p>“Hurt!” exclaimed the unfortunate one, scrambling to his
feet, “I believe every bone of my body is broken into, and by
gracious! my head is cracked, and both legs put out of joint,
the left arm broke above the elbow, and the right one severed
completely!”</p>

<p>Notwithstanding these frightful injuries, the speaker was
moving about with wonderful dexterity.</p>

<p>“My gracious! what do you suppose I’ve tumbled into?” he
suddenly asked.</p>

<p>“Into a pitfall or a hole in the ground,” replied Graham.
“It’s my opinion, too, that it will be very easy with this noise
we are making to stumble into the Mohawks’ hands.”</p>

<p>“I should think you ought to know that I <em>didn’t</em> fall,” retorted
Seth angrily. “I happened to see sumthin’, and I
stepped forward to see if it would hold my weight. What you
are laughing at, I should like to know!”</p>

<p>“What is it that you have stepped into?” asked Haverland.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span></p>

<p>“Why, nothing less than a <em>boat</em>, dragged up here by the
varmints, I ’spose.”</p>

<p>Such indeed was the case. There was a very large-sized
canoe directly before them, and not a sign of the presence of
others beside themselves. Not a more fortunate thing could
have happened. Upon examination, the boat was found to be
of unusual length and breadth, and amply sufficient to carry
twenty men. It was quickly pushed back into the stream.</p>

<p>“Come, tumble in and we’ll set sail,” said Seth.</p>

<p>The fugitives without any hesitation entered the boat, and
Seth and Haldidge, bending their shoulders to it, shoved it into
the river, and sprang in as it floated away.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIX" id="CHAPTER_XIX"></a>CHAPTER XIX.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">DENOUEMENT.</span></h2>


<p>The whites found in a moment that they had committed a
great mistake in launching as they did. In the first place,
there was not an oar in the boat, and thus, not being able to
“paddle their own canoe,” they were also deprived of the ability
to paddle one belonging to some one else. Besides this, the river
was dark as Styx, and the whole sky and air were of the
same inky blackness, and not one in the boat had the remotest
idea of where they were going&mdash;whether it was to pitch over
some falls, down some rapids or into the bank.</p>

<p>“I’m going to set down and consider which is the biggest
fool, Haldidge, you or me, in starting out in this canoe which
we <em>borrowed</em> for a short time.”</p>

<p>So saying, Seth made his way to the stem of the canoe
when he rested himself&mdash;not upon the bottom of it, as he expected,
but upon something <em>soft</em>, which emitted a grunt audible
to all, as he did so.</p>

<p>“My gracious! what’s under me?” he exclaimed, reaching
his hand down and feeling around in the dark. “A live Injin
as sure as my name is Seth Jones. Ah, you copper-headed
monkey!”</p>

<p>It was as said. An Indian had stretched out on his
back with his feet dangling over the edge of the canoe, and
Seth, without the faintest suspicion of his presence, had seated
himself square upon his breast. As may be supposed, this was
not relished at all by the startled savage, and he made several
strenuous efforts to roll him off.</p>

<p>“Now, just lay still,” commanded Seth, “for I’ve an idea
that I can’t find a more comfortable seat.”</p>

<p>The savage was evidently so thoroughly frightened that he
ceased his efforts and lay perfectly quiet and motionless.</p>

<p>“Have you got a real Indian here?” asked Haldidge, as he
came to Seth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>

<p>“To be sure I have; just feel under me and see if I hain’t.”</p>

<p>“What you going to do with him?”</p>

<p>“Nothing.”</p>

<p>“Are you going to let him off? Let’s pitch him overboard.”</p>

<p>“No, you won’t, Haldidge. I’ve two or three good reasons
for not doing such a thing. In the first place, there ain’t no
need of it, the poor imp hasn’t hurt us; and, for all I detest
his whole cowardly race, I don’t believe in killing them except
when they’ve done you some injury or are trying to. The
most important reason, however, is that I don’t want my seat
disturbed.”</p>

<p>“He is a cussed fool to let you sit on him that way. I’d
give you a toss if I was in his place that would send you
overboard.”</p>

<p>“Not if you knew what was best for you. Thunder!”</p>

<p>Perhaps the Indian understood the words of the hunter.
At any rate, he made an attempt to carry out his suggestion,
and well nigh did it, too. Just as Seth gave vent to the exclamation
recorded, he pitched headlong against Haverland,
knocking him over upon his back, and falling upon him. At
the same instant the savage sprang overboard and swam rapidly
away in the darkness.</p>

<p>“That’s a mean trick,” said Seth, as he recovered his sitting
position, “I was just setting on him to keep the rain off.
Jest like the ungrateful dog!”</p>

<p>The attention of all was now directed to the progress of
the canoe. Drifting swiftly onward through the darkness, no
one knowing whither, their situation began to assume a terrible
form. There was no power in their hands to guide it, and
should they run into any of the trees which had caught in the
bottom, or upon a rock, they would be instantly swamped.
But there was no help for it and each one seated and braced
himself for the shock which might come at any instant.</p>

<p>It was while they were proceeding in this manner, that they
all heard the bottom of the canoe grate over something, then
tremble for a moment, and suddenly came to a stand still.
The stem swung rapidly round and commenced filling.</p>

<p>“Overboard men, all of you! We’re sinking!” commanded
Haldidge.</p>

<p>Each sprang into the water which was not more than two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
feet deep, and the canoe, thus lightened of its load, instantly
freed itself and floated off in the darkness.</p>

<p>“Don’t move till I take a few soundings,” said Seth.</p>

<p>He naturally supposed that to reach the shore, he must take
a direction at right angles with the current. A few steps
showed him that he was not in the river itself, but was walking
in that portion which had overflowed its banks.</p>

<p>“Follow on boys; we’re right!” he called out.</p>

<p>Bushes and grass entangled their feet, and the branches
overhead brushed their faces as they toiled out of the water.
A few moments and they were upon solid land again. The
canoe had carried them across the river, so that this troublesome
task was finished.</p>

<p>“Now if we only had a fire,” said Haverland.</p>

<p>“Yes; for Ina must be suffering.”</p>

<p>“Oh! don’t think of me!” replied the brave, little girl,
cheerfully.</p>

<p>Seth discovered with his customary shrewdness that the
storm had been very slight in this section, and the wood was
comparatively dry. By removing the leaves upon the surface
of the ground, there were others beneath which were perfectly
free from dampness. A quantity of these were thrown in a
heap, a number of twigs found among them, placed upon the
top, and some larger branches piled upon these in turn. After
great difficulty, Seth managed to catch a spark from his steel
and tinder, and in a few moments they had a rousing, roaring
genial fire.</p>

<p>“That’s fine,” said Graham. “But won’t it be dangerous,
Seth?”</p>

<p>“Let it be then, I’m bound to dry my skin to night if there’s
any vartue in fire.”</p>

<p>But the Indians didn’t choose to disturb them, although it
was rather a reckless proceeding upon their part. It was more
than probable, as Seth Jones remarked, that their pursuers had
lost their trail, and would experience some difficulty in regaining
and following it.</p>

<p>Morning at last broke upon the hungry, miserable, hopeful
fugitives. As the light increased they looked about them and
discovered that they had encamped at the base of a large, heavily
wooded hill. It was also noticed that Haldidge, the hunter,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
was absent. While wondering at this, the report of his
rifle was heard, and in a few moments he was seen descending
the hill, bending under the weight of a half-grown deer.
This was hastily dressed, several good-sized pieces skewered
and cooked in the flame, and our five friends made as hearty
and substantial a meal as was ever made in this world.</p>

<p>“Before starting upon our journey again,” said Haldidge,
“I want you all to go to the top of the hill here with me and
see what a fine view we shall have.”</p>

<p>“Oh! we’ve no time for views!” replied Seth.</p>

<p>“I am afraid there is little spare time,” added the woodman.
“But this is particularly fine, and I think you will be well
pleased with it.”</p>

<p>The hunter was so urgent that the others were finally
obliged to consent. Accordingly they commenced the ascent,
Haldidge leading them, and all anxiety, smiles, and expectation.</p>

<p>“See how you like that view!” said he, pointing off to the
west.</p>

<p>The fugitives gazed in the direction indicated. The prospect
was one indeed which, just at that time, pleased them
more than could have any other in the universe; for below
them about half a mile distant, was the very village toward
which they had been so long making their way. It looked
unusually beautiful that morning in the clear sunshine. A
score of cabins nestled closely together, and the heavy smoke
was lazily ascending from several chimneys, while here and
there a settler could be seen moving about. At one corner of
the village stood the block-house, and the gaping mouth of its
swivel shone in the morning sun like burnished silver. One
or two small boats were visible in the water, their ashen paddles
flashing brightly as they were dipped by strong and active
hands. The river down which the woodman and his
wife and sisters had escaped, flowed at the foot of the village,
and its windings could be traced by the eye for miles. Here
and there, scattered over the country for miles could be seen an
enterprising settler’s cabin, resembling in the distance a tiny
bee-hive.</p>

<p>“You haven’t told me how you are pleased with the landscape?”
said the hunter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span></p>

<p>“Ah, Haldidge, you know better than to ask that question,”
replied Haverland in a shaking voice. “Thank God that He
has been so merciful to us!”</p>

<p>They now commenced descending the hill. Not a word
was exchanged between them, for their hearts were too full
for attendance. A strange spell seemed to have come over
Seth Jones. At sight of the village, he had suddenly become
thoughtful and silent, refusing even to answer a question. His
head was bent down. Evidently his mind was engrossed upon
some all-absorbing subject. Several times he sighed deeply,
and pressed his hand to his heart, as though the tumultuous
throbbing there pained him. The expression of his face was
wonderfully changed. That quizzing, comical look was entirely
gone, while wrinkles at the eyebrows and base of the
nose could be seen no more. His face appeared positively
handsome. It was a wonderful metamorphosis, and the question
passed around unexpressed: “is that Seth Jones?”</p>

<p>All at once, he seemed to become sensible that the eyes of
others were upon him, and that he had forgotten himself.
That old, peculiar expression came back to his face, and a few
steps of the old straddling gait were taken, and Seth Jones
was himself again!</p>

<p>The sentinels in the block-house had discovered and recognized
the fugitives, and when they arrived at the palisade
which surrounded the village, there were numbers waiting to
receive them.</p>

<p>“I will see you all again!” said Haldidge, separating from
the others and passing toward the upper end of the settlement.</p>

<p>After pausing a few moments to answer the inquiries of
their friends, Haverland led the way toward the cabin where
he had left his wife and sister. Here he found the good settlers
had erected and presented him with a house. As he
stepped softly to the door, intending to give his wife a playful
surprise, she met him. With a low cry of joy, she sprang forward
and was held in his arms, and the next instant she and
Ina were clasped together and weeping.</p>

<p>“Thank Heaven! thank Heaven! Oh, my dear, dear child,
I thought you lost forever.”</p>

<p>Graham and Seth stood respectfully to one side for a few<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
moments. The latter cleared his throat several times and
brushed his arm across his forehead in a suspicious manner.
As the mother regained herself, she turned and recognized
Graham, and greeted him warmly.</p>

<p>“And you, too,” she said, taking Seth’s hand and looking
up into his face, “have been more than a friend to us. May
Heaven reward you, for <em>we</em> never can.”</p>

<p>“There! by gracious! don’t say no more!&mdash;boohoo! ahem!
I believe I’ve caught a cold being so exposed to the night air!”</p>

<p>But it was no use; the tears <em>would</em> come; and Seth, for a
few seconds, wept like a baby, yet smiled even through his
tears. They all entered the house.</p>

<p>“Our first duty is to thank God for his mercy. Let us all
do it,” said the woodman.</p>

<p>All sank devoutly upon their knees, joining in fervent
thanksgiving to the great Being who had shown his goodness
to them in such a marvellous manner.</p>

<p>The settlers, with true politeness of heart, forebore to intrude
until they judged the family were desirous of seeing them.
After they had arisen from their knees, Mary, the sister of
Haverland, entered. Graham chanced to glance at Seth that
moment, and was startled at the emotion he exhibited. He
flushed scarlet, and trembled painfully, but, by a strong effort
recovered himself in time to greet her. She thanked him
again and commenced conversing, when she saw that he was
embarrassed and ill at ease. A flash of suspicion crossed her
fine calm face, and it became pale and flushed by turns.
What a riot emotion was making in her heart only she herself
knew:&mdash;her face soon became passive and pensive; and a pathos
gleamed from her sad eyes which sent Seth quickly out
of doors to commune with the mysteries of his own
thoughts.</p>

<p>The cabin was crowded until near midnight with congratulating
friends. Prominent among these, was the man who
officiated in the capacity of minister for the settlement. He
was a portly, genial, good-natured man, of the Methodist persuasion,
and a preacher for the times&mdash;one who could plow,
reap, chop wood, and lead the settlers against their foes when
he deemed it necessary, or preach and practice the gospel before
them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>

<p>It was a glad&mdash;a happy reunion&mdash;a night that was long remembered.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Just one week after the reunion, the little party was seated
in Haverland’s home, composed of Ina, Seth Jones, the woodman,
Mrs. Haverland, and Mary. Seth sat in one corner conversing
with Ina, while the other three were also together.
There was a happy look upon each face. Even the sweet melancholy
beauty of Mary was lightened up by a smile. She
was beautiful&mdash;queenly so. Her hair, black as night, was
gathered behind, as if to restrain its tendency to curl; but in
spite of this, a refractory one was constantly intruding itself.
A faint color was visible in her cheeks, and her blue eye had
in it something of a gleam of the common joy and peace.</p>

<p>Seth had remained most of the time with the woodman.
Several times he had asked Mary Haverland to walk with
him, and yet, upon each occasion, when about to start, he become
painfully nervous and begged to be excused. And then
his language was so different at times. Often he would converse
with words so polished and well chosen, as to show unmistakably
that he was a scholar. Perhaps the reader has
noticed this discrepancy in his conversations. It attracted attention,
and strengthened many in their belief that for some
unknown reason he was playing a part.</p>

<p>At the present time, there was a nervousness in his manner;
and, although he was holding a playful conversation with Ina,
his eyes were constantly wandering to the face of Mary Haverland.</p>

<p>“And so you and Graham are going to be married to-morrow
night?” he asked.</p>

<p>“You know, Seth, that we are. How many times are you
going to ask me?”</p>

<p>“Do you love him?” he asked, looking her steadily in the
face.</p>

<p>“What a question! I have <em>always</em> loved him, and <em>always
will</em>.”</p>

<p>“That’s right; then marry him, for if man ever loved woman,
he loves you! And, Alf; while I think of it,” he spoke in
a louder tone, “what has that big, red-haired fellow been hanging
around here so much, for the last day or two?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span></p>

<p>“You will have to ask Mary,” laughed the woodman.</p>

<p>“Oh! I understand; there’ll be two weddings to-morrow
night, eh? That’s so, Mary?”</p>

<p>“Not that I know of; I have no expectation of becoming a
wife for any one.”</p>

<p>“Hain’t eh? Why the man seems to love you. Why
don’t you marry him?”</p>

<p>“I am afraid Mary will never marry,” said Haverland. “She
has rejected all offers, though many were from very desirable
men.”</p>

<p>“Queer! I never heard of such a case.”</p>

<p>“Her love was buried long ago,” replied Haverland, in a
lower tone, to Seth.</p>

<p>After a moment’s silence, Seth arose, took his chair, and
seated himself beside her. She did not look at him, nor did
any one else. He sat a moment; then whispered:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Mary?”</p>

<p>She started. Her eyes flashed like meteors in his face a
moment; then she turned as pale as death, and would have
fallen from her chair, had not Seth caught her in his arms.
Haverland looked up in amazement; the whole family were
riveted in wonder. Seth looked up from the face of the fainting
woman, and smiled as he said: “She is mine, forever!”</p>

<p>“Merciful heaven! Eugene Morton!” exclaimed Haverland,
starting to his feet.</p>

<p>“It is so!” said the one addressed.</p>

<p>“Have you risen from the dead?”</p>

<p>“I have risen to life, Alf, but have never been with the
dead.”</p>

<p>Instead of the weak, squeaking tone which had heretofore
characterized his speech, was now a rich, mellow bass, whose
tones startled Mary into life again. She raised her head, but
he who held her, would not permit her to arise. He pressed
her fervently to his bosom. The ecstasy of that moment, only
the angels in heaven could fathom.</p>

<p>Haldidge and Graham entered, and the man in his true
character, arose to his feet&mdash;a tall, dignified, graceful, imposing
person.</p>

<p>“Where is Seth?” asked Graham, not noticing the apparent
stranger.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span></p>

<p>“Here is what you have heretofore supposed to be that individual,”
laughed the person before him, enjoying greatly
their astonishment.</p>

<p>“Seth, truly, but not Seth, either,” exclaimed they both,
with astonishment written on their faces.</p>

<p>“With a few words,” he commenced, “all will be plain to
you. I need not tell you, friends, that my character, since my
advent among you, has been an assumed one. Seth Jones is
a myth, and to <em>my</em> knowledge, no such person ever existed.
My real name is Eugene Morton. Ten years ago, Mary Haverland
and I pledged our love to each other. We were to be
married in one year; but, when a few months of that time had
elapsed, the Revolutionary War broke out, and a call was
made upon our little village, in New Hampshire, for volunteers.
I had no desire, nor right to refuse. Our little company
proceeded to Massachusetts, where the war was then
raging. In a skirmish, a few days after the battle of Bunker
Hill, I was dangerously wounded, and was left with a farmer
by the wayside. I sent word by one of my comrades to
Mary, that I was disabled, but hoped to see her in a short time.
The bearer of that message probably was killed, for it is certain,
my words never reached her; though a very different
report, did. We had a man in our company, who was a lover
of Mary’s. Knowing of my misfortune, he sent her word that
I was killed. When I rejoined my company, a few months
after, I learned that this man had deserted. A suspicion that
he had returned home, impelled me to obtain leave of absence
to visit my native place. I there learned that Haverland, with
his wife and sister, had left the village for the West. One of
my friends informed me that this deserter had gone with them,
and, it was understood, would marry Mary. I could not doubt
the truth of this report, and, for a time, I feared I should commit
suicide. To soften this great sorrow, I returned at once,
joined our company, and plunged into every battle that I
possibly could. I often purposely exposed myself to danger,
soliciting death rather than life. In the winter of 1776, I
found myself under General Washington, at Trenton; I had
crossed the Delaware with him, and, by the time it was fairly
light, we were engaged in a desperate fight with the Hessians.
In the very heat of the battle, the thought suddenly came to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
me, that the story of Mary’s marriage was untrue. Singularly
enough, when the battle was over, I did not think any more
of it. But in the midst of the following engagement at Princeton,
the same thought came to me again, and haunted me from
that time, until the close of the war. I determined to seek
out Mary. All that I could learn, was, that Haverland had
emigrated ‘out this way.’ If she <em>had</em> married the deserter, I
knew it was under a firm belief that I was dead. Consequently
I had no right to pain her by my presence. For this
reason, I assumed a disguise. I discolored my now long untamed
hair. It so changed my whole appearance, that I
hardly knew myself. My youthful color was now changed
into the bronze of war, and sorrow had wrought its changes.
It was not strange then, that any old friend should not know
me, particularly when I could so successfully personate the
‘Green Mountain Boy,’ in voice and manner. My identity
was perfectly secure, I knew, from detection. I came in this
section, and after a long and persevering hunt, one day I
found Haverland cutting in the wood. I introduced myself
to him as Seth Jones. I found Mary. The report which
had reached me of her marriage was false, she was still true
to her first love! I should have made myself known then,
had not the danger which threatened Haverland, come upon
him almost immediately. As his family were then tormented
by the fate of Ina, I thought my recognition would only serve
to embarrass and distract their actions. Besides, I felt some
amusement in the part I was playing, and often enjoyed the
speculation I created, by giving you, as it were, a glimpse
now and then into my real nature, I varied my actions and
language, on purpose to increase your wonder.” He here
paused and smiled, as if at the recollection of his numerous
ludicrous escapades. He continued: “I have little more to
add. I congratulate you, Graham, on the prize you have won.
You are to be married to-morrow night. Mary, will you not
marry me at the same time?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied the radiant woman, placing her hands in his.
“You have my hand now, as you have had my heart through
all these long, sorrowing years.”</p>

<p>Morton kissed her forehead tenderly.</p>

<p>“Now, congratulate <em>me</em>,” said he, with a beaming face.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span></p>

<p>And they gathered around him, and such shaking of hands,
and such greetings, we venture to say, were never seen before.
Our friends experienced some difficulty at first, in believing
that Seth Jones was gone forever. They even felt some regrets
that his pleasing, eccentric face had passed away; but,
they had gained in his place, a handsome, noble-hearted man,
of whom they were all proud.</p>

<p>The next day was spent in preparations for the great double
wedding that was to take place that evening. Messengers
were sent up and down the river, and back into the woods,
there was not a settler within twenty miles, who had not been
invited. At nightfall, the company began to collect. Some
came in boats, some on horseback, and others on foot. A
double wedding rarely took place in the backwoods, and
while this occasion was too full of romance to be slighted by
any, old or young.</p>

<p>When the lights were produced in the woodman’s house,
there was a motley assemblage without and within. You
could have heard old and middle-aged men talking about the
prospect of the crops, and looking up to the sky, and wisely
predicating the probabilities of a change in the weather, or
discussing, in anxious tones, the state of feeling among the
Indians along the frontier; you could have heard&mdash;as they
would be termed now-a-days&mdash;“gawky” young men as sagely
discoursing upon the same subjects, venturing a playful thrust
now and then, at one of their number about some “Alminy,”
or “Serapheemy,” sweetheart.</p>

<p>The woodman’s house had been much enlarged for the
occasion. A long shed amply sufficient to contain all the
guests, was built alongside, and connecting with it. After
participating in a bountiful meal in this, the tables were removed,
and preparation made for the marriage.</p>

<p>A sudden hush fell upon the assemblage. All eyes turned
toward the door, through which Eugene Morton and Edward
Graham, each with his affianced leaning upon his arm entered.</p>

<p>“Ain’t they purty?”</p>

<p>“Don’t they look bootiful?”</p>

<p>“Golly! if they ain’t <em>some</em>, then there’s no use in talking!”</p>

<p>Such and similar were the whispered remarks of admiration
at the couple. Mary Haverland was dressed in a plain, light<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
colored dress, without any ornament, except a single white
rose in her hair, which now fell in dark masses over her
shoulders. Her beauty was of the truly regal type. She was
very happy, yet seemed as if in a world of her own.</p>

<p>Horton was clad in gray homespun, which well became his
graceful form. His whole appearance was that of the <em>gentleman</em>,
which he was&mdash;a brave soldier, a true-hearted man.</p>

<p>Ina, the sweet, young heroine, was fascinating. Her dress
was of the purest white. Her curls clustered around her
shoulders, and were confined at the temples by a simple wreath
of blue violets. There was a contrast between Ina and Mary,
and yet it would have been a difficult task to have judged
which was the most beautiful&mdash;the pure, queenly, trusting
woman, or the purity and innocence of the young maiden.
Graham was a worthy participant in the drama, and pleased
all by his goodness and intelligence.</p>

<p>In a few moments, a portly gentleman, with a white neckcloth,
and all aglow with smiles, entered the room. Morton
and Mary arose and stood before him, and amid the most perfect
silence the ceremony commenced. The questions were
put and answered in a firm voice, audible to every one in the
room.</p>

<p>“What God hath joined together let not man put asunder.”</p>

<p>And every voice said “Amen!” as they reseated themselves.</p>

<p>Haldidge, who had stood as groomsman to Morton, now signaled
with a quiet smile for Graham to take his position. The
young hero did, and Ina, blushing deeply, and leaning on the
arm of her bridemaid, followed, and the ceremony commenced.</p>

<p>While this was proceeding, an interesting affair was occurring
on the opposite end of the room. A large, bony, red-faced
young man, sat holding and squeezing the hand of a
bouncing buxom girl, and indulging in several expressive remarks.</p>

<p>“I swow, if they don’t look purty. Wonder how the gal
feels?”</p>

<p>“Why happy, of course,” replied his companion.</p>

<p>“By jingo, I bet <em>he</em> does; I know <em>I</em> would.”</p>

<p>“You would what?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span></p>

<p>“Feel glorious if I was in <em>his</em> place.”</p>

<p>“What! marrying Ina Haverland?”</p>

<p>“No&mdash;I mean&mdash;ahem!&mdash;why, somebody else&mdash;that is&mdash;yes,
<em>somebody</em> else.”</p>

<p>“Who else do you mean?” asked the girl, looking him
steadily in the face.</p>

<p>“Why&mdash;ahem!&mdash;why, <em>you</em>! darn it, now you know, don’t
you?”</p>

<p>“Sh! Don’t talk so loud, Josiah, or they’ll hear you.”</p>

<p>“S’posen you was in her place, Sal; how <em>would</em> you
feel?”</p>

<p>“Ain’t you ashamed of yourself?” she asked reprovingly.</p>

<p>“No, darnation, I don’t care. Say, Sal, how would you
feel?”</p>

<p>“Do you mean if I was standing out there with you, and
the minister talking so to us?”</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;yes; why don’t you tell me?”</p>

<p>“You know well enough, Josiah, without asking me no such
question.”</p>

<p>Josiah commenced meditating. Some desperate scheme was
evidently troubling him, for he scratched his head and then
his knees, and then laughed, and exclaimed to himself, “I’ll do
it, by George!” Then turning toward the girl, he said:</p>

<p>“Sal, let’s you and I get married, won’t you?”</p>

<p>“Why, Josiah?” and she hung her head and blushed
charmingly.</p>

<p>“Come, Sal, the old folks won’t care. Let’s do it, won’t
you?”</p>

<p>“Oh, Josiah!” she continued, growing nervous and fidgety.</p>

<p>“Come, say quick, for the dominie is near done, and he’ll
go home. Say <em>yes</em>; Sal, do.”</p>

<p>“Oh, dear! oh, my stars!&mdash;<span class="smcap">YES</span>!”</p>

<p>“Good, by jingo! Hurry up there, Mr. Preacher.”</p>

<p>At this point, the good minister ceased his benediction upon
the couples, and their friends commenced crowding around
them. The minister started, not to go home, but to leave the
room for a moment, when Josiah noticed it, and fearing that
he was going called out:</p>

<p>“Say, squire&mdash;you, dominie, I mean, just wait, won’t you
here’s another job for you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span></p>

<p>“Ah! I am glad to hear it!” laughed the minister, turning
round. “Are you the happy man?”</p>

<p>“Wal, I reckon so, and I cac’late as how, Sal Clayton
there is the happy gal.”</p>

<p>All eyes were turned toward the speaker, and he stood their
smiles unflinchingly. His face was of a fiery red, and a large,
flowing necktie hung disregarded over his breast.</p>

<p>“Go in, Josiah; that’s you!” exclaimed several patting him
on the shoulder.</p>

<p>“Get out all of you, till I’m through. Come up here, Sal;
no use scroochin’ now.”</p>

<p>The females bore the blushing one forward, until she was
near enough for Josiah to get hold of her hand.</p>

<p>“Now go ahead, squire&mdash;you&mdash;minister, I mean, and don’t be
too thundering long about it, for I want to get married most
terribly.”</p>

<p>The company gave way, and the two stepped forward, and in
a few moments were pronounced man and wife. When
Josiah saluted his bride, the smack was a telling one, and the
congratulations of Morton and Graham were nothing to those
which were showered upon the happy man.</p>

<p>Now the sport commenced. An old ranger suddenly made
his appearance, bearing a violin under his arm&mdash;“a reg’lar
old cremony,” as he termed it. The word was given to “make
ready for the dance!” The old folks disappeared and entered
the house, where, with the minister, they indulged in conversation,
story-telling, nuts, apples, and cider.</p>

<p>The fiddler coiled himself upon the top of a box, and commenced
twisting the screws of his instrument, and thumbing
the strings. The operation of “tuning” was evidently a painful
one, for it was noticed that at each turn of the screw, he
shut one eye and twisted his mouth.</p>

<p>The violin was at length tuned, the bow was given two or
three sweeps across a lump of rosin, and then drawn across
the strings, as if it said “attention!” As the couples were
forming, the violinist slid partly down off the box, so that one
foot could beat upon the sanded floor, and then, giving his
head a jerk backward, struck up a reel that fairly set every
heart dancing. The floor was immediately filled with the
young folks. Tall, strapping fellows plunged around the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
room, like skeletons of india-rubber, their legs bowed out, and
sometimes tripping over each other. Rousing, solid girls
bounded around, up and down like pots of jelly, and “all went
merry as a marriage-bell.”</p>

<p>By and by the old folks made their appearance “just to see
the boys and gals enjoy themselves.” The fiddler at this moment
shot off on the “Devil’s Dream.” A timid elderly lady
stepped up to him, and touching him softly on the shoulder,
asked:</p>

<p>“Isn’t that a <em>profane</em> tune?”</p>

<p>“No, it’s Old Hundredth with variations&mdash;don’t bother me,”
replied the performer, relieving his mouth of a quantity of tobacco
juice at the same time.</p>

<p>“Supposing we try it for a moment, aunt Hannah,” said the
minister with a sly look.</p>

<p>The two stepped out on the floor, the fiddler commenced
another tune, and they disappeared in the whirling mass. In
a few moments nearly all of the old folks who had come just
to “see them a minute,” followed, and the way in which several
elderly gentlemen and ladies executed some of the reels of
a half-century’s memory, was a lesson to the younger folks.</p>

<p>The company kept up their revelry until far beyond midnight.
But by and by they commenced withdrawing. It was
proposed by several to visit the different bridegrooms in bed,
but fortunately the good taste of the others prevailed, and
they departed quietly homeward.</p>

<p>Slumber, with the exception of the sentinels at the block-house,
fell upon the village. Perhaps the Indians had no wish
to break in upon such a happy settlement, for they made no
demonstration through the night. Sweetly and peacefully
they all slept; sweetly and peacefully they entered upon life’s
duties on the morrow; and sweetly and peacefully these happy
settlers ascend and went down the hillside of life.</p>

<p class="center xlargefont">MR. EDWARD S. ELLIS’ WORKS.</p>

<p class="center largefont">(Dime Series.)</p>

<p>The author of “Seth Jones,” “Bill Biddon,” “Forest Spy,” “Hunter’s
Cabin,” “Oonomoo,” etc., by these works at once established his
reputation as the best delineator of Border and Indian life now writing
for the press. He was introduced by the publishers of the <span class="smcap">Dime
Novels’</span> series to the public, and has contributed to their enterprise
works which will be read as long as they are published. Among
those already issued are:</p>

<p class="adhead">SETH JONES; OR, THE CAPTIVES OF THE FRONTIER.</p>

<p>This inimitable story created a great sensation upon its first appearance.
“Who is Seth Jones?” was the inquiry from Maine to Minnesota.
It was answered by a novel whose sale, to this moment, is unabated.
The work is illustrative of life in the early settlements of New
York, when the Indian carried terror into many a forest home. It is
a story of true beauty and power, with a sprinkling of most delicious
humor, and can not fail to please.</p>

<p class="adhead">BILL BIDDON, TRAPPER;</p>

<p>Or, Life in the North-west. Mr. Ellis here presents a life-like delineation
of the life of hunters and trappers in that vast region surrounding
the head-waters of the Yellowstone, and stretching away on
the Red River trail. Through it runs the thread of a sweet love-story,
and the excitement of the rescue of a beautiful white captive
from the Blackfeet-Sioux Indians. It is a romance of exceeding interest,
and worthy of the author’s fine repute.</p>

<p class="adhead">THE FRONTIER ANGEL:</p>

<p>A Romance of Kentucky Rangers’ Life. The Frontier Angel is no
fictitious personage. Her memory is still treasured in the West
among the descendants of those who first braved the savages in Kentucky
and Southern Ohio. The author has woven, from her course,
a romance of true beauty and power. It has been <em>very</em> popular in the
Dime series.</p>

<p class="adhead">NAT TODD; OR, THE FATE OF THE SIOUX’ CAPTIVE.</p>

<p>Though a sequel to “Bill Biddon,” this novel is perfect in itself.
The odd Nat here plays a leading part, and carries the reader <em>per
force</em> along with him over the plains into the fastnesses of the far
North-west, whither he pursues a <em>shadow</em>. It is a very odd, and a
truly enticing and satisfactory story.</p>

<p class="adhead">THE TRAIL HUNTERS;</p>

<p>Or, Monowano, the Shawnee Spy. A story of the “Dark and
Bloody Ground” (Kentucky) in its heaviest trial, and when very
many noble characters came out on the page of history. Mr. Ellis
daguerreotypes the life and action of those days with wonderful distinctiveness.
The delight inspired by a perusal of such novelty as
this is greatly enhanced by the historical accuracy of its delineations.</p>

<p class="adhead">THE FOREST SPY: A TALE OF THE WAR OF ’12.</p>

<p>For this fine work the author has been complimented by its classification
with J. Fenimore Cooper’s best conceptions. It introduces us
to a remarkable character&mdash;one who played an important and dramatic
part in the war of 1812&mdash;to Harrison, Tecumseh and Proctor;
and while history is verified, it is subordinate to a romance of singular
power and interest.</p>

<p class="adhead">IRONA; OR, LIFE ON THE SOUTH-WEST BORDER.</p>

<p>Texan life, Texan love and Texan character make up the warp and
woof of this stirring story. To a leading drama of most exciting nature
the author adds many side incidents and events of a refreshing
character. The celebrated <cite>White Steed of the Pampas</cite>, for instance,
plays his part. An adventure with alligators adds a terrible interest
to several chapters. Altogether “Irona” is a very readable romance.</p>

<p class="adhead">THE RIFLEMEN OF THE MIAMI:</p>

<p>A Tale of Southern Ohio. The “Riflemen” were true sons of the
forest, with hearts of fire and nerves of steel, who became the settlers’
hope and Indians’ terror. The author has seized upon a stirring
episode of their memorable career to give us a book quite as attractive
as any thing which has fallen from the American press since
“Leatherstocking” found its way over Europe and America.</p>

<p class="adhead">THE HUNTER’S CABIN.</p>

<p>This novel is also located in Southern Ohio; the time late in the
last century, when the fierce Shawnee and bloodthirsty Delaware carried
death along the borders. The events recorded in this work are
such as to kindle a fervid enthusiasm in the reader’s mind for the
man and woman who braved all to establish civilization in those then
distant wilds. A charming love-story runs through the entire narrative.</p>

<p class="adhead">OONOMOO, THE HURON.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the merits of some of the works named above,
this story is fully equal to the others. It reproduces the noble Huron
Indian who plays so prominent a part in the “Riflemen” and the
“Hunter’s Cabin.” It is a work of great power and beauty.</p>

<p class="center largefont">A STIRRING AND IMPRESSIVE STORY.</p>

<p class="center largefont boldfont">THE GOLDEN BELT; OR, THE CARIB’S PLEDGE.</p>

<p class="center smallfont">BY COLIN BARKER.</p>

<p>The scene is laid in the tropics, just after the discovery of this country
by Columbus, when the old Castilian line of Spaniards first stepped
upon these shores. The hero is a gallant Spanish Cavalier, who received
a belt of virgin gold from the hands of a Carib Chief, as a pledge
that he should guard his life. Our hero woos an Indian maiden, and
after many thrilling adventures leads her to the altar&mdash;being the first
maiden of the princely Carib line who wed a Spanish subject.</p>

<p class="center xlargefont">HON. A. J. H. DUGANNE’S WORKS.</p>

<p class="center largefont">(Dime Series.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Duganne</span> stands confessedly in the front rank of American novelists.
His works are familiar to all readers of pure <em>American</em> fiction.
He writes with a pen facile with the graces of composition, while his
mind fairly overflows with its prolific resources of plot, incident and
character. He has favored the <span class="smcap">Dime Novels’</span> series with his latest as
well as his best works. Among them are:</p>

<p class="adhead">MASSASOIT’S DAUGHTER;</p>

<p>Or, the French Captives. Sameeda, daughter of Massasoit, was an
Indian Princess of rare beauty and virtues. Her life was full of romance,
and her relation to the whites have rendered her name memorable.
This story is one of unusual power and dramatic interest&mdash;as
full of incident as the most exacting reader could desire. It is one
of the most popular novels in the series.</p>

<p class="adhead">THE PEON PRINCE;</p>

<p>Or, the Yankee Knight-Errant. If oddity of character and novelty
of adventure contribute to a good story, we have them here in perfect
fullness. The story introduces us to Mexico as it was under the Guerrilla
reign a few years ago, and gives us pictures of the country and
its remarkably varied life, which challenge attention from their novelty;
and exciting nature.</p>

<p class="adhead">PUTNAM POMFRET’S WARD;</p>

<p>Or, the Vermonter in Mexico. This, though really a sequel of “The
Peon Prince,” is yet entirely distinct as a story. It is characterized
by whimsicality, excitement, power and the true beauty of a first-class
romance. The reader seeking for a “treat” will find it in this picture
of life in Mexico.</p>

<p class="adhead">THE KING’S MAN;</p>

<p>A Story of South Carolina in Revolutionary times. Mr. Duganne
here presents us with a fine historical romance, seizing upon that moment
when the city of Charleston was being defended by the brave
Moultrie to introduce us to that element of South Carolina’s disloyalty
which rendered many of her citizens infamous in the eyes of patriots.
The story as a story is unusually exciting. Its succession of commanding
events hurries before us commanding characters, male and
female&mdash;reminding us strongly of Bulwer’s masterpieces of historic
composition.</p>

<p class="center largefont">A CAPITAL STORY.</p>

<p class="center largefont boldfont">KING BARNABY;</p>

<p>Or, the Maidens of the Forest. A romance of the Mickmacks, in
Canada. By <span class="smcap">N. Wm. Busteed</span>, Esq., a well-known New York lawyer.
It deals with Indian life and the exciting incidents of their conflicts
with the whites, introducing a great variety of characters, both male
and female. While the story is historically true, it is, in all the elements
of the romance, exceedingly enticing and satisfactory.</p>

<p class="center xlargefont">MRS. M. A. DENISON’S WORKS.</p>

<p class="center largefont">(Dime Series.)</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Dime Novels’</span> series include some of Mrs. <span class="smcap">Denison’s</span> most popular
and valued works. As a writer of <cite>Home</cite> and <cite>Fireside Tales</cite> Mrs.
D. has won an enviable fame in American literature. Her contributions
to the Dime series comprise several of more than usual power
and excellence. We may refer the reader in quest of good stories for
the family circle and the parlor to the following:</p>

<p class="adhead">CHIP, THE CAVE-CHILD.</p>

<p>A romance of the wilds of Pennsylvania, attracting and commingling
with life in Philadelphia. It is a somewhat singular story,
but well calculated to enchain attention. The characters in chief
are an old woman, and a child whom she has stolen and dragged
away to a den in the wilderness, where she seeks to keep her. The
narrative comprises a drama of unique interest, pathos and beauty.</p>

<p class="adhead">THE PRISONER OF LA VINTRESSE.</p>

<p>This novel tells the Fortunes of a Cuban Heiress. The scene is
laid in Cuba, but is, eventually, transferred to New York. The
characters are every-day delineations; the story reads very much
like “facts stranger than fiction.” We are not sure but it is true to
life. It forms a very absorbing book&mdash;one particularly pleasing to
those still in the romantic period of their lives.</p>

<p class="adhead">FLORIDA; OR, THE IRON WILL.</p>

<p>The first announcement of this work said:&mdash;“It is one of the most
powerful and beautiful romances yet penned by Mrs. Denison. The
action and characters are all in the life of to-day&mdash;living and moving
in our midst, and acting out the drama of life as it is, in certain
social circles of our cities.”</p>

<p class="adhead">RUTH MARGERIE;</p>

<p>Or, the Revolt of 1689. The author here introduces the reader
to one of the most exciting episodes in the history of the Massachusetts
Bay Colony. The successful revolt of the people against
the tyranny of Sir Edmund Andros is seized upon to weave
around it a romance of peculiar interest, placing before us incidents
and characters that excite much of the intense feeling created
by Hawthorne’s romance of “The Scarlet Letter.”</p>

<p class="adhead">TIM BUMBLE’S CHARGE;</p>

<p>Or, the One Great Sorrow. Another story of to-day&mdash;a tale of
New England and New York city life, full of spirit of country and
city, in which a woman’s joys and sorrows float like a beacon to command
our attention. It is a novel possessed of all the author’s best
characteristics.</p>

<p class="adhead">THE MAD HUNTER;</p>

<p>Or, the Downfall of the Le-Forests. Mrs. Denison here gives us a
picture of blended light and shade. The number of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">dramatis personæ</i>
and the rapid succession of peculiar events combine to produce a very
novel novel. Those who admire novelty of drama and circumstances
will consider this one of the author’s best stories.</p>

contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate

intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
